THE MEANING OF YOUR COMMISSION</h3>


<p>Upon being commissioned in the Armed Services of the
United States, a man incurs a lasting obligation to cherish
and protect his country and to develop within himself that
capacity and reserve strength which will enable him to serve
its arms and the welfare of his fellow Americans with increasing
wisdom, diligence, and patriotic conviction.</p>

<p>This is the meaning of his commission. It is not modified
by any reason of assignment while in the service, nor is the
obligation lessened on the day an officer puts the uniform
aside and returns to civil life. Having been specially chosen
by the United States to sustain the dignity and integrity of
its sovereign power, an officer is expected so to maintain
himself, and so to exert his influence for so long as he may
live, that he will be recognized as a worthy symbol of all
that is best in the national character.</p>

<p>In this sense the trust imposed in the highest military commander
in the land is not more than what is encharged the
newest ensign or second lieutenant. Nor is it less. It is the fact
of commission which gives special distinction to the man and
in turn requires that the measure of his devotion to the service
of his country be distinctive, as compared with the charge
laid upon the average citizen.</p>

<p>In the beginning, a man takes an oath to uphold his
country's Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic,
to bear true faith and allegiance, and to discharge well
and faithfully the duties of office. He does this without any
mental reservation.</p>

<p>Thereafter he is given a paper which says that because the
President as a representative of the people of this country
reposes "special trust and confidence" in his "patriotism,
valor, fidelity, and abilities," he is forthwith commissioned.</p>

<p>By these tokens, the Nation also becomes a party to the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>tract,
and will faithfully keep its bond with the man. While
he continues to serve honorably, it will sustain him and will
clothe him with its dignity. That it has vouched for him gives
him a felicitous status in our society. The device he wears, his
insignia, and even his garments identify him directly with the
power of the United States. The living standards of himself
and of his family are underwritten by Federal statute. Should
he become ill, the Nation will care for him. Should he be
disabled, it will stand as his guardian through life. Should
he seek to advance himself through higher studies, it will
open the way.</p>

<p>Other than the officer corps, there is no group within our
society toward which the obligation of the Nation is more
fully expressed. Even so, other Americans regard this fact
with pride, rather than with envy. They accept the principle
that some unusual advantage should attend exceptional and
unremitting responsibility. Whatever path an American officer
may walk, he enjoys prestige. Though little is known of his
intrinsic merit, he will be given the respect of his fellow
citizens, unless he proves himself utterly undeserving.</p>

<p>This national esteem for the corps is one of the priceless
assets of American security. The services themselves so recognize
it. That they place such strong emphasis upon the importance
of personal honor among officers is because they
know that the future of our arms and the well-being of our
people depend upon a constant renewing and strengthening
of public faith in the virtue of the corps. Were this to
languish, the Nation would be loath to commit its sons to
any military endeavor, no matter how grave the emergency.</p>

<p>The works of goodwill by which those who lead the national
military forces endeavor to win the unreserved trust of the
American people is one of the chief preservatives of the
American system of freedoms. The character of the corps is in
a most direct sense a final safeguard of the character of the
Nation.</p>

<p>To these thoughts any officer who is morally deserving of
his commission would freely subscribe. He will look beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the letter of his obligation and will accept in his own heart
the total implications of his new responsibility.</p>

<p>So doing, he still might see fit to ask: "But to what do I
turn my thoughts? How do I hold myself so that while following
the line of duty, I will also exemplify those ideals
which may inspire other men to make their best effort?"</p>

<p>It is suggested that there is a one-word key to the answer
among the four lofty qualities which are cited on every man's
commission.</p>

<p>That word is <em>Fidelity</em>.</p>

<p>As for patriotism, either a man loves his country or else he
would not seek commission at its hands, unless he be completely
the rascal, pretending to serve in order to destroy.</p>

<p>Valor, on the other hand, can not be fully vouchsafed, since
it is not given to any man to know the nature and depth of his
personal courage.</p>

<p>Abilities vary from man to man, and are partly what heredity
and environment have made them. If nature had not imposed
a ceiling, mere striving would make every man a genius.</p>

<p>But Fidelity is the derivative of personal decision. It is the
jewel within reach of every man who has the will to possess it.</p>

<p>Given an officer corps composed throughout of men who
would make the eternal try toward bettering their professional
capacities and furthering the working efficiency and harmony
within all forces, the United States would become thrice-armed
though not producing one new weapon in its arsenals.</p>

<p>Great faith, rightness of mind, influence over other men,
and finally, personal success and satisfaction come of service
to the ideals of the profession. Were these strengths reflected
throughout the officer body, it could well happen that because
of the shining example, the American people would
become more deeply conscious of the need to keep their own
fibers strong than has been their disposition throughout
history.</p>

<p>Accepting these truths as valid, a man still must know
where he stands before making a true reckoning of his line
of advance. This entails some consideration of himself (<em>a</em>) as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to the personal standard which is required of him because
of his position in relation to all others (<em>b</em>) as to the reasons
in common sense which make this requirement, and (<em>c</em>) as
to the principles and philosophy which will enable him to
play his part well.</p>

<p>The military officer is considered a gentleman, not because
Congress wills it, nor because it has been the custom of
people in all times to afford him that courtesy, but specifically
because nothing less than a gentleman is truly suited for his
particular set of responsibilities.</p>

<p>This is not simply a bit of self-adulation; it is distinctly the
American tradition in the matter. The Nation has never attempted
to draw its officers from a particular class. During
World War II, thousands of men were commissioned in our
forces who had enjoyed little opportunity in their earlier environments.
They were sound men by nature. They had courage.
They could set a good example. They could rally other men
around them. In the eyes of the services, these things count
more than any man's blood lines. We say with Voltaire, "Whoever
serves his country well has no need of ancestors."</p>

<p>On the other hand, from the time of the Colonies, this
country has despised press gangs, floggings, martinetism, and
all of the other Old World military practices which demeaned
the rank and file. Its military system was founded on the
dignity of man, just as was its Constitution. The system has
sought ever since to advance itself by appealing to the higher
nature of the individual. That is why its officers need to be
gentlemen. To call forth great loyalty in other people and to
harness it to any noble undertaking, one must first be sensible
of their finer instincts and feelings. Certainly these things
at least are among the gentle qualities which are desired in
every military officer of the United States:</p>


<ol>
<li>Strong belief in human rights.</li>

<li>Respect for the dignity of every other person.</li>

<li>The Golden Rule attitude toward one's daily associates.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>An abiding interest in all aspects of human welfare.</li>

<li>A willingness to deal with every man as considerately
as if he were a blood relative.</li>
</ol>

<p>These qualities are the epitome of strength, not of softness.
They mark the man who is capable of pursuing a great purpose
consistently in spite of temptations. He who possesses
them will all the more surely be regarded as a "man among
men." Take any crowd of new recruits! The greater number
of them during their first few days in service will use more
profanity and obscenity, talk more about women and boast
more about drinking than they have ever done in their lives,
because of the mistaken idea that this is the quick way to get
a reputation for being hard-boiled. But at the same time,
the one or two men among them who stay decent, talk moderately
and walk the line of duty will uniquely receive the infinite
respect of the others. It never fails to happen!</p>

<p>There is the other matter about how a man should feel
toward his own profession. Simply to accept the fact that the
bearing of arms is a highly honorable calling because the book
says so should not suffice one's own interest in the matter, when
a little personal reflection will reveal wherein the honor resides.</p>

<p>To every officer who has thought earnestly about the business,
it is at once apparent that civilization, as men have known it
since the time of the Greek City States, has rested as a pyramid
upon a base of organized military power. Moreover, the general
possibility of world cultural progress in the foreseeable future
has no other conceivable foundation. For any military man to
deny, on any ground whatever, the role which his profession
has played in the establishment of everything which is well-ordered
in our society, shows only a faulty understanding of
history. It made possible the birth of the American system of
freedoms. Later, it gave the nation a new birth and vouchsafed
a more perfect union.</p>

<p>Likewise, we need to see the case in its present terms. One
may abhor war fully, despise militarism absolutely, deplore all
of the impulses in human nature which make armed force
necessary, and still agree that for the world as we know it, the
main hope is that "peace-loving nations can be made obviously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
capable of defeating nations which are willing to wage aggressive
war." Those words, by the way, were not said by a
warrior, but by the eminent pacifist, Bertrand Russell. It does
not make the military man any less the humanitarian that he
accepts this reality, that he faces toward the chance forthrightly,
and that he believes that if all military power were
stricken tomorrow, men would revert to a state of anarchy and
there would ensue the total defeat of the forces which are
trying to establish peace and brotherly love in our lives.</p>

<p>The complete identity of American military forces with the
character of the people comes of this indivisibility of interest.
To think of the military as a guardian class apart, like Lynkeus
"born for vision, ordained for watching," rather than as a
strong right arm, corporately joined to the body and sharing its
every function, is historically false and politically inaccurate. It
is not unusual, however, for those whose task it is to interpret
the trend of opinion to take the line that "the military" are
thinking one way and "the people" quite another on some
particular issue, as if to imply that the two are quite separate
and of different nature. This is usually false in detail, and
always false in general. It not only discounts the objects of their
unity but overlooks the truth of its origins.</p>

<p>Maybe they should be invited to go to the root of the word.
The true meaning of "populus," from which we get the word
"people," was in the time of ancient Rome the "armed body."
The pure-blooded Roman in the days of the Republic could not
conceive of a citizen who was not a warrior. It was the arms
which a Roman's possession of land enabled him to get that
qualified him to participate in the affairs of state. He had no
political rights until he had fought. <em>He was not of the people;
they were of him!</em> Nor is this concept alien to the ideals on
which the Founding Fathers built the American system, since
they stated it as the right and duty of every able-bodied citizen
to bear arms.</p>

<p>These propositions should mean much to every American who
has chosen the military profession. A main point is that on
becoming an officer a man does not renounce any part of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
fundamental character as an American citizen. He has simply
signed on for the post graduate course where one learns how
to exercise authority in accordance with the spirit of liberty.
The nature of his trusteeship has been subtly expressed by an
Admiral in our service: "The American philosophy places the
individual above the state. It distrusts personal power and
coercion. It denies the existence of indispensable men. It asserts
the supremacy of principle."</p>

<p>An understanding of American principles of life and growth,
and personal zeal in upholding them, is the bedrock of sound
leading in our services. Moral and emotional stability are expected
of an American officer; he can usually satisfy his superiors
if he attains to this equilibrium. But he is not likely to
satisfy himself unless he can also achieve that maturity of
character which expresses itself in the ability to make decisions
in detachment of spirit from that which is pleasant or unpleasant
to him personally, in the desire to hold onto things
not by grasping them but by understanding them and remembering
them, and in learning to covet only that which may be
rightfully possessed.</p>

<p>An occasional man has become wealthy while in the services
by making wise investments, through writings, by skill at invention,
or through some other means. But he is the exception.
The majority have no such prospect. Indeed, if love of money
were the mainspring of all American action, the officer corps
long since would have disintegrated. But it is well said that the
only truly happy people on earth are those who are indifferent
to money because they have some positive purpose which forecloses
it. Than the service, there is no other environment which
is more conducive to the leading of the full life by the individual
who is ready to accept the word of the philosopher that
the only security on earth is the willingness to accept insecurity
as an inevitable part of living. Once an officer has made this
passage into maturity, and is at peace with himself because the
service means more to him than all else, he will find kinship
with the great body of his brothers-in-arms. The highest possible
consequence can develop from the feelings of men mutually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
inspired by some great endeavor and moving forward together
according to the principle that only those who are willing to
serve are fit to lead. Completely immersed in action, they have
no time for smallness in speech, thought or deed. It is for these
reasons that those who in times past have excelled in the leadership
of American forces have invariably been great Americans
first and superior officers second. The rule applies at all levels.
The lieutenant who is not moved at the thought that he is
serving his country is unlikely to do an intelligent job of directing
other men. He will come apart at the seams whenever the
going grows tough. Until men accept this thought freely, and
apply it to their personal action, it is not possible for them to go
forward together strongly. In the words of Lionel Curtis: "The
only force that unites men is conscience, a varying capacity in
most of them to put the interests of other people before their
own."</p>

<p>The services are accustomed to being hammered. Like other
human institutions, they are imperfect. Therefore the criticisms
are not always unjust. Further, there is no more reason why the
services should be immune to attack than any other organic
part of our society and government.</p>

<p>The service officer is charged only to take a lively interest in
all such discussions. He has no more right to condemn the
service unfairly than has any other American. On the other
hand he is not expected to be an intellectual eunuch, oblivious
to all of the faults in the institution to which he gives his
loyalty. To the contrary, the nature of that loyalty requires that
he will use his force toward the righting of those things which
reason convinces him are going wrong, though making certain
that his action will not do more damage than repair.</p>

<p>His ultimate commanding loyalty at all times is to his country,
and not to his service or his superior. He owes it to his country
to speak the truth as he sees it. This implies a steadying judgment
as to when it should be spoken, and to whom it should be
addressed. A truth need not only be well-rounded, but the
utterance of it should be cognizant of the stresses and objectives
of the hour. Truth becomes falsehood unless it has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
strength of perspective. The presentation of facts is self-justifying
only when the facts are developed in their true proportion.</p>

<p>Where there is public criticism of the services, in matters both
large and small, the service officer has the right and the duty of
intervention only toward the end of making possible that all
criticism will be well-informed. That right can not be properly
exercised when there is nothing behind it but a defense of professional
pride. The duty can be well performed when the officer
knows not only his subject&mdash;the mechanism itself&mdash;but
the history and philosophy of the armed services in their relation
to the development of the American system. Criticism from
the outside is essential to service well-being, for as Confucius
said, oftentimes men in the game are blind to what the lookers
on see clearly.</p>

<p>The value of any officer's opinion of any military question
can never be any greater than the extent and accuracy of his
information. His ability to dispose public thought favorably
toward the service will depend upon the wisdom of his words
rather than upon his military rank and other credentials. A false
idea will come upon a bad fate even though it has the backing
of the highest authority.</p>

<p>Only men of informed mind and unprejudiced expression can
strengthen the claim of the services on the affections of the
American people.</p>

<p>This is, of itself, a major objective for the officer corps, since
our public has little studious interest in military affairs, tends
ever to discount the vitality of the military role in the progress
and prosperity of the nation and regards the security problem
as one of the less pleasant and abnormal burdens on an otherwise
orderly existence.</p>

<p>It is an explicable contradiction of the American birthright
that to some of our people the military establishment is at best a
necessary evil, and military service is an extraordinary hardship
rather than an inherent obligation. Yet these illusions are rooted
deep in the American tradition, though it is a fact to be noted
not without hope that we are growing wiser as we move
along. In the years which followed the American Revolution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the new union of States tried to eliminate military forces altogether.
There was vast confusion of thought as to what freedom
required for its own survival. Thomas Jefferson, one of the
great architects of democracy, and still renowned for his "isolationist"
sentiments, wrote the warning: "We must train and
classify the whole of our male citizens, and make military instruction
a regular part of collegiate education. We can never be
safe until this is done."</p>

<p>None the less, the hour came when the standing Army was reduced
to 80 men. None the less, the quaint notion has survived
that an enlightened interest in military affairs is somehow undemocratic.
And none the less, recurring war has invariably
found the United States inadequately prepared for the defense
of its own territory.</p>

<p>Because there has been a holdover of these mistaken sentiments
right down to the present, there persists in many military
officers a defensive attitude toward their own profession which
has no practical relation to the strength of the ground on which
they are enabled to stand. Toward any unfair and flippant criticism
of the "military mind" they react with resentment, instead
of with buoyant proof that their own minds are more plastic
and more receptive to national ideals than those of any other
profession. Where they should approach all problems of the
national security with the zeal of the missionary, seeking and
giving light, they treat this subject as if it were a private game
preserve.</p>

<p>It suffices to say of this minority that they are a barnacle on
the hull of an otherwise staunch vessel. From such limited concepts
of personal responsibility, there can not fail to develop a
foreshortened view of the dignity of the task at hand. The note
of apology is injected at the wrong time; the tone of belligerency
is used when it serves no purpose. When someone arises within
the halls of government to say that the military establishment
is "uneconomic" because it cuts no bricks, bales no hay and
produces nothing which can be vended in the market places, it
is not unusual to hear some military men concur in this strange
notion. That acquiescence is wholly unbecoming.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>The physician is not slurred as belonging to a nonproductive
profession because he contributes only to the care and healing
of the body, and through these things to the general well-being
of society. Respect for formal education, organized religion
and all of the enterprises built up around the dissemination
of ideas is not the less because the resultant benefit to
society is not always tangible and saleable. Hence to say that
that without which society could not endure in its present form
is "uneconomic" is to make the word itself altogether meaningless.</p>

<p>In that inner power of courage and conviction which stems
from the spiritual integrity of the individual, lies the strength of
democracy. As to their ability to produce toward these ends, the
military services can stand on the record. When shortly after
World War II, a census was taken among the returned men,
60 percent said that they had been <em>morally strengthened</em> by
their military service in the American uniform. About 30 percent
had no opinion or felt that military life had not changed them
one way or the other. An insignificant minority considered themselves
damaged. This is an amazing testimony in light of the
fact that only a small fraction of American youth is schooled to
believe that any spiritual good can come of military service. As
to what it signifies, those who take a wholly materialistic view
of the objects of the Republic are entitled to call the military
establishment "uneconomic." The services will continue to hold
with the idea that strong nationhood comes not of the making
of gadgets but of the building of character.</p>

<p>Men beget goodwill in other men by giving it. They develop
courage in their following mainly as a reflection of the courage
which they show in their own action. These two qualities of
mind and heart are of the essence of sound officership. One is of
little avail without the other, and either helps to sustain the
other. As to which is the stronger force in its impact upon the
masses of men, no truth is more certain than the words once
written by William James: "Evident though the shortcomings
of a man may be, if he is ready to give up his life for a cause,
we forgive him everything. However inferior he may be to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>selves
in other respects, if we cling to life while he throws it
away like a flower, we bow to his superiority."</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt once said that if he had a son who refrained
from any worthwhile action because of the fear of hurt
to himself, he would disown him. Soon after his return to
civilian life, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke of the worthwhileness
of "living dangerously." An officer of the United
States armed forces can not go far wrong if he holds with
these ideas. It is not the suitable profession for those who
believe only in digging-in and nursing a soft snap until death
comes at a ripe old age. Who risks nothing gains nothing.</p>

<p>Nor should there be any room in it for professional smugness,
small jealousies, and undue concern about privilege.</p>

<p>The regular recognizes as his peer and comrade the officer
from any of the civilian components. That he is a professional
does not give him an especial eminence, but simply a greater
measure of responsibility for the success of the total establishment.
Moreover, he can not afford to be patronizing, without
risking self-embarrassment, such is the vast experience which
many reservists have had on the active field of war.</p>

<p>Toward services other than his own, any officer is expected to
have both a comradely feeling and an imaginative interest.
Any Army officer is a better man for having studied the works
of Admiral Mahan and familiarized himself with the modern
Navy from first-hand experience. Those who lead sea-going
forces can enlarge their own capacities by knowing more, rather
than less, about the nature of the air and ground establishments.
The submariner can always learn something useful to his
own work by mingling with airmen; the airman becomes a
better officer as he grows in qualified knowledge of ground and
sea fighting.</p>

<p>But the fact remains that the services are not alike, that no
wit of man can make them alike, and that the retention by each
of its separate character, customs and confidence is essential to
the conserving of our national military power. Unification has
not altered this basic proposition. The first requirement of a
unified establishment is moral soundness in each of the integral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
parts, without which there can be no soundness at all. And on
the question of fundamental loyalty, the officer who loves every
other service just as much as his own will have just as much
active virtue as the man who loves other women as much as
his own wife.</p>

FORMING MILITARY IDEALS</h3>


<p>Any stranger making a survey of what Americans are and
how they get that way would probably see it as a paradox that
within the armed establishment the inculcation of ideals is considered
the most vital of all teaching, while in our gentler and
less rigid institutions, there is steadily less emphasis on this
subject.</p>

<p>He would be entitled to the explanation that it is not so done
because this has always been the way of Armies, Navies, and
other fighting forces, or because it is universal in the military
establishments of the twentieth century, but because nothing
else would better suffice the American military system under
present conditions.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons why.</p>

<p>The first is that we are an altogether unregimented people,
with a strong belief in the virtues of rugged individualism and
in the right of the average man to go along about as he pleases,
so long as he does not do actual injury to society. Voluntary
group cooperation rather than absolute group loyalty, developing
from a strong spiritual bond, is the basic technic of
Americans in their average rounds. It is enough to satisfy the
social, political and economic needs of a democracy, but in its
military parts, it would be fatally weak. There would be no
possibility of achieving an all-compelling unity under conditions
of utmost pressure if no man felt any higher call to action than
what was put upon him by purely material considerations.</p>

<p>Military ideals are therefore, as related to this purpose, mainly
an instrument of national survival. But not altogether so, since
in the measure that they influence the personal life and conduct
of millions of men who move in and out of the services, they
have a regenerative effect upon the spiritual fiber of the Nation
as a whole.</p>

<p>There is the second and equally important reason that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
whereas wars have sometimes been fought for ideal causes, as
witness the American Revolution and Civil War, war itself is
never ideal, and the character of our people is such as to insist
that from our side, its brutalities be minimized. The barbarian
who kills for killing's sake and who scorns the laws of war at
any point is repugnant to the instincts of our people, under
whatever flag he fights. If we did not have some men of this
type among us, our penitentiaries would not be filled. The
ravages which they might commit when all of the barriers are
down on the battlefield can be prevented only when forces as a
whole believe that armed power, while not ideal in itself, must
be made to serve ideal ends.</p>

<p>To speak of ethics in the same breath with war may seem like
sheer cant and hypocrisy. But in the possibility that those who
best understand the use and nature of armed power may excel
all others in stimulating that higher morality which may some
day restrain war lies a main chance for the future. The Armed
Services of the United States do not simply do lip service to
such institutions as United Nations. They encourage their people
to take a deep personal interest in every legitimate activity
aimed to bulwark world peace. But while doing this, they keep
their powder dry.</p>

<p>Military ideals are not different than the ideals which make
any man sound in himself, and in his relation to others. They
are called military ideals only because the proving ground is a
little more rugged in the service than elsewhere. But they are all
founded in hard military experience; they did not find expression
because some Admiral got it in his head one day to set an
unattainable goal for his men, or because some General wished
to turn a pious face toward the public, professing that his men
were aspiring to greater virtue than anything the public knew.</p>

<p>The military way is a long, hard road, and it makes extraordinary
requirements of every individual. In war, particularly,
it puts stresses upon men such as they have not known elsewhere,
and the temptation to "get out from under" would be
irresistible if their spirits had not been tempered to the ordeal.
If nothing but fear of punishments were depended upon to hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
men to the line during extreme trial, the result would be wholesale
mutiny and a situation altogether beyond the control of
leadership. So it must be true that <em>it is out of the impact of
ideals mainly that men develop the strength to face situations
from which it would be normal to run away</em>.</p>

<p>Also, during the normal routine of peace, members of the
Armed Services are expected to respond to situations that are
more extensive, more complex, and take longer to reach fulfillment
than the situations to which the majority of men instinctively
respond. Even the length of the enlistment period
looks like a slow march up a 60-mile grade. Promotion is slow,
duty frequently monotonous. It is all too easy for the individual
to worry about his own insignificance and to feel that he has
become lost in the crowd. Under these conditions a man may go
altogether bad, or simply get lazy and rock with the grain.
But nothing except a strong belief in the ideals he is serving
will make him respond to the larger situation and give it his
best effort. Ideals have the intensely practical end of strengthening
men for the better discharge of duties which devolve upon
them in their day-to-day affairs.</p>

<p>What is the main test of human character? Probably it is this:
that a man will know how to be patient in the midst of hard
circumstance, and can continue to be personally effective while
living through whatever discouragements beset him and his
companions. Moreover, that is what every truly civilized man
would want in himself during the calmer moments when he
compares critically what he is inside with what he would like
to be. That is specifically the reason why the promulgation of
military ideals is initially a problem in the first person, singular.
The Armed Services have in one sense a narrow motive in
turning the thoughts of younger leaders toward a belief in
ideals. They know that this is a lubricant in the machinery of
organization and the best way to sweeten the lives of men
working together in a group toward some worthwhile purpose.
But there is also a higher object. All experience has taught that
it is likewise the best way to give the individual man a solid
foundation for living successfully amid the facts of existence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
irrespective of his situation. The military system of the United
States is not committed to grinding out warriors <em>per se</em>, but to
the training of men in such manner that they will be able to
play a better part anywhere, and will find greater satisfactions
in what they do. All the time, when the service seeks to emphasize
to its ranks what is the "right thing to do," it is speaking
of that course of conduct which in the long run is most
necessary and useful to the individual.</p>

<p>As to what one man should seek in himself, in order to be
four-square with his own life and all others who are related to
his personal situation, it is simple enough to formulate it, and to
describe what constitutes maturity of character. In fact, that
can be done without mentioning the words "patriotism" and
"courage", which traditionally and rightly are viewed as the
very highest of the military virtues.</p>

<p>No man is truly fit for officership unless in the inner recess of
his being he can go along with the toast known to every American
schoolboy: "My country, in her intercourse with other
nations may she always be in the right! But right or wrong, my
country!" And he will never do a really good job of supporting
her standards if, when the clutch comes, he is lacking in intestinal
fortitude.</p>

<p>But there is this to be said about the nature of courage and
patriotism, in the same breath that we agree they are essential
in an officer of the fighting establishment&mdash;neither of these
qualities of itself carries sufficient conviction, except as it is the
product of those homelier attributes which give dignity to all
action, in things both large and small, during the course of
any average work day.</p>

<p>When Dr. Johnson remarked that patriotism is the last refuge
of a scoundrel he was not belittling the value of love of country
as a force in the lives of men, but to the contrary, was
pointing out that a profession of patriotism, unaccompanied by
good works, was the mark of a man not to be trusted. In no
other institution in the land will flag-waving fall as flat as in
the Armed Services when the ranks know that it is just an act,
with no sincere commitment to service backing it up. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
uniformed forces will still respond to the real article with the
same emotion that they felt at Bunker Hill and Manila Bay.</p>

<p>There is a Civil War story from one of the campaigns against
Stonewall Jackson in the Valley. A Confederate who had had
his leg shot away turned on his pallet to regard a Union private
who had just lost an arm, and said to him, "For what reason
did you invade us and make all this trouble?" The boy replied
simply: "For the old flag." That may sound like sentiment from
a distant past. But turn to the story of Major Devereux and the
Marine defense of Wake Island. He wrote that the "music"
had always gone sour, and had invariably broken down when
he tried to play "The Colors." But on the morning of Pearl
Harbor, when the flag was raised, the garrison already knew
that the war was on. And for some reason which no man
could account for, the bugler rose to the occasion, and for the
first time, every note came straight and true. Devereux said that
every throat tightened and every head went higher. Yet Devereux
was a remarkably unmelodramatic fighting man.</p>

<p>But to get back to those simpler virtues which provide a firm
foundation for patriotism and may become the fount of courage,
at least these few things would have to be put among the fundamentals:</p>


<ol>
<li>A man has honor if he holds himself to a course of
conduct, because of a conviction that it is in the general
interest, even though he is well aware that it may lead to
inconvenience, personal loss, humiliation or grave physical
risk.</li>

<li>He has veracity if, having studied a question to the
limit of his ability, he says and believes what he thinks to
be true, even though it would be the path of least resistance
to deceive others and himself.</li>

<li>He has justice if he acknowledges the interests of all
concerned in any particular transaction rather than serving
his own apparent interest.</li>

<li>He has graciousness if he acts and speaks forthrightly,
agrees warmly, disagrees fairly and respectfully, participates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>enthusiastically, refrains from harboring grudges, takes his
reverses in stride, and does not complain or ask for help in
the face of trifling calamities.</li>

<li>He has integrity if his interest in the good of the
service is at all times greater than his personal pride, and
when he holds himself to the same line of duty when unobserved
as he would follow if all of his superiors were
present.</li>
</ol>

<p>The list could be longer, but for the moment, we can let it go
at that. These standards are not counsels of perfection; thousands
of officers have adhered to them. But it should be said as
well that if all leaders at the lower levels in all of the services
were to conform in the same way, the task of higher command
would be simplicity itself. The cause of much of the friction in
the administrative machinery is that at all levels there are individuals
who insist on standing in their own light. They believe
that there is some special magic, some quick springboard to
success; they mistakenly think that it can be won by bootlicking,
apple-polishing, yessing higher authority, playing office politics,
throwing weight around, ducking the issues, striving for cheap
popularity, courting publicity or seeking any and all means of
grabbing the spotlight.</p>

<p>Any one of this set of tricks may enable a man to carry the
ball forward a yard or two in some special situation. But at least
this comment can be made without qualification: Of the men
who have risen to supreme heights in the fighting establishment
of the United States, and have had their greatness proclaimed
by their fellow countrymen, there is not one career which provides
any warrant for the conclusion that there is a special
shortcut known only to the smart operators. True enough, a
few men have gained fairly high rank by dint of what the late
Mr. Justice Holmes called "the instinct for the jugular"&mdash;a
feeling for when to jump, where to press and how to slash in
order to achieve somewhat predatory personal ends. That will
occasionally happen in any walk of life. But from Washington,
Wayne, and Jones down to Eisenhower, Vandegrift, and Nimitz,
the men best loved by the American people for their military
successes were also men with greatness of soul. In short, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
were idealists, though they likely would have disclaimed that
label, since it somehow connotes the visionary rather than the
intensely practical man.</p>

<p>But it isn't necessary to look at the upper brackets of history
to find the object lesson. The things that any man remembers
about his own father with love and reverence have to do with
his forbearance, his charity toward other men, his strength and
rightness of will and his readiness to contribute of his force to
the good of other people. Or if not his father, then it may be an
uncle, a neighbor or one of his schoolmasters.</p>

<p>In one way, however, it illuminates but half the subject to
reflect that a man has to find purpose in himself before he can
seek purpose in any of the undertakings of which he is a part
or in the society of which he is a member. No man is wholly
sufficient unto himself even though he has been schooled from
infancy to live according to principles. His character and the
moral strength from which he gains peace of mind need constantly
to be replenished by the force of other individuals who
think and act more or less in tune with him. His ability to remain
whole, and to bound back from any depression of the
spirit, depends in some measure on the chance that they will be
upgrading when he is on the downswing. To read what the
wisest of the philosophers have written about the formation of
human character is always a stimulating experience; but it is
better yet to live next to the man who already possesses what the
philosophers are talking about. During World War II, there
were quite a few higher commanders relieved in our forces because
it was judged, for one reason or another, that they had
failed in battle. Of the total number, there were a few who
took a reduction in rank, went willingly to a lower post in a
fighting command, uttered no complaint, kept their chins up,
worked courageously and sympathetically with their commands,
and provided an example of manhood that all who saw them
will never forget. Though their names need not be mentioned,
they were imprinted with the real virtue of the services even
more deeply than many of their colleagues who had no blemishes
on their records. Their character had met the ultimate test.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
The men who had the privilege of working close to them realized
this and the sublime effect of this personal influence helped
strengthen the resolve of many others.</p>

<p>Because there is so much at stake in the matter, the services
cannot depend solely upon such influence as would be exerted
on their affairs by the occasional idealist, but must work for
that chain reaction which comes of making the inculcation of
military ideals one of the cardinal points of a strong, uniting
inner doctrine. It is altogether necessary that as a body, the
power of their thought be shaped along ideal lines. The ideal
object must be held high at all times, even though it is recognized
that men are not perfect, and that no matter how
greatly they may aspire, they will occasionally fail. Nor is the
effort to lead other men to believe in the transcendent importance
of goodwill made less effective because the leader has a
conscience about his own weakness, <em>provided he has the good
sense not to flaunt it</em>. He need not be a paragon of all the
virtues to set an example which will convince other men that
his ideas are worth following. No man alive possesses perfect
virtue, which fact is generally understood. Many an otherwise
ideal commander is ruthless in his exactions upon his staff;
many a petty officer, who has won the absolute love of all men
with whom he served, has found himself in the middle because
he couldn't think straight about his debts. But these things do
not lessen the impact upon men of thinking together about
common ideals and working together toward the fulfillment of
some high obligation. The pursuit of ideals culminates in the experience
of mutual growth. If that were not so, men who have
served the arms of the United States would not continue to have
a special respect for the uniform, and an extra reverence for the
flag, for years after they have passed from the service. These
emotions are not the consequence of habit, but come of having
known the comradeship of other men whom they loved and
respected, who shared these same thoughts, and believed in the
same body of ideals.</p>

<p>Any normal man loves his country and it is natural in him
to regard highly the symbols through which this affection is ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>pressed.
An American child of kindergarten age already feels an
emotional attachment for the national emblem. The recruit who
has just entered upon service can begin to understand that his
regard for his uniform must be a far different thing than what
he felt about his civilian dress, since it is identified with the
dignity of the Nation. His training in military ideals starts at
this point, and for the main part is carried forward subtly, by
transfer of this same feeling to all other objects associated with
his military life. His perseverance in the care of weapons, in
keeping his living quarters orderly and in doing his full share
of work is best insured, not through fear of punishments, but
by stimulating his belief that any other way of going is unworthy
of a member of a fighting service.</p>

<p>Precision in personal habits, precision in drill and precision in
daily living are the high road to that kind of discipline which
best insures cool and collected thought and unity of action on
the field of battle. When men, working together, successfully
attain to a high standard of orderliness, deportment and response,
each to the other, they develop the cohesive strength
which will carry them through any great crisis. For this reason
mainly, military life is far more exacting than civil life. But the
services hold that what is best for the many can be achieved
without cramping the personal life or blighting individuality
and initiative. Within the frame of our system, we can achieve
obedience and discipline without destroying independence and
impulse.</p>

<p>This is idealism, though we seldom think about it in that
light. Further, it is all the better that in the beginning these
impressions are developed obliquely, rather than through the
direct approach of reading a lecture on ideals and ethics, since
it means that the man is assisted to reach certain conclusions by
himself, and as Kant has said, those things which a man learns
pretty much on his own become the ideas that he is least likely
to forget.</p>

<p>Looking at this subject in its largest aspect, it should be perfectly
clear that any institution must know what its ideals are
before it can become coherent and confident, and that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
must be present in the form of clearly available ideas an
imaginative conception of the good at which the institution
aims.</p>

<p>This is fully recognized in the American armed establishment.
For many years, the program of indoctrinating military
ideals has been inseparably linked with instruction in democratic
ideals, teaching as to the American way of life and clear
statement of the policies and purposes of the Government of
the United States in its relations with all others powers and
peoples.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is an accepted principle in all services that this
mission can not be carried forward competently except by those
officers who are directly in charge of forces. It is not a job for
chaplains or orientation specialists, because it cannot flourish
unless it is in the hands of those leaders whom men know well
and in whom they place their confidence. When men are well
led, they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas
which their leaders see fit to put before them.</p>

<p>There are two points which follow, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>An officer's ability to talk effectively on these or other subjects
to his men can be no better than his information, irrespective of
his zeal or of his own firm belief in the ideals of his country and
service.</p>

<p>All other things being equal, his effectiveness will depend on
the extent to which he participates in all of the other affairs of
organization. If he is remote from the spirit of his own unit, and
indifferent to the varying activities which enter into the building
of that spirit, he will not have a sympathetic audience when
he talks to men about the grand objectives of organization.
There is something terribly incongruous about a man talking to
troops on the ideal purposes of the military service if all they
see of him convinces them that he is loyal only to his own rank
and his pay check. It can be said without any qualification that
when an officer's interest in the unit is limited strictly to those
things which <em>have to be done</em> in line of duty, even though he
attends to them truly and well, he will never have a strong hold
on the sympathy and imagination of his men. When he takes an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
enthusiastic part in the sports program of the ship, the company,
the squadron or the battalion, even though he has no
natural talent for sport, when he voluntarily helps in furthering
all activities within the unit which are designed to make leisure
more enjoyable, and when he is seen by his men attending
religious exercises, his magnetism is increased. It was noteworthy
during World War II that church attendance among
enlisted personnel took a tremendous bound forward when it
was seen that their officers were present at church services. This
provided tremendous support to those chaplains who were
intent not only on praising the Lord but on passing moral
ammunition to all ranks so that they would be better prepared
for the ordeal ahead.</p>

<p>Recognizing that instruction in the duties of citizenship, and
providing information which will enable Americans to have a
better understanding of their national affairs, is part of the arch
of morale and of a strong uniting comradeship, the Armed
Services nevertheless hold that <em>the keystone of the arch, among
fighting forces, is the inculcation of military ideals and the
stimulation of principles of military action</em>. Unless orientation
within the services is balanced in this direction, the military
spirit of all ranks will suffer, and the forces will deteriorate into
an assembly of Americans who, whatever their enthusiasms for
the nation, will lack an organized capacity to serve it efficiently
along the main line of resistance.</p>

<p>To round out any discussion of how military ideals are
formed, much more needs to be said about the nature of courage
on the battlefield and, in preparation for it, about the
winning and meaning of loyalty within the Armed Services
and how instruction on these points and all related matters is
best advanced within the organization.</p>

<p>But the object of this chapter is to define certain governing
principles. The substantive parts of the subject can be more
clearly presented further along in the book.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_THREE" id="CHAPTER_THREE"></a><span class="chapter_number">CHAPTER THREE</span><br /><br />

RESPONSIBILITY AND PRIVILEGE</h3>


<p>There is a common saying in the services, and elsewhere, that
greater privileges grow out of larger responsibilities, and that
the latter justifies the former. This is part truth and part fable.</p>

<p>In military organization, as in industry, business, and political
life, the more important a man's position, the more lavish he is
likely to be in his office appointments and living arrangements,
and the greater the care that is apt to be taken in freeing him of
trifling annoyances.</p>

<p>But that is only partly because of the need for him to conserve
his time and energy. When men are successful, they like
the good things of life. Why deny it? Not one individual in
10,000 would aspire to power and authority if it meant living
like a hermit.</p>

<p>There is no way that the military establishment can denature
human nature, and change this determining condition. Nor is
there any reason why it should wish to do so. Its men, like all
others, develop a sense of well-being from those advantages,
many of them minor, which attend, and build prestige, both in
private and in official life. The incentive system by which our
country has prospered has always recognized that privilege is a
reward for effort and enterprise. The American people have
always accepted that reasonable, harmless privileges should attend
merit. It is by enhancing the prestige of leaders and by
making their positions attractive that the Armed Forces get
better officers and men.</p>

<p>One of the keenest-minded Americans of our time has said:
"Responsibilities are what devolve upon a person, and privileges
are what he ought not to have, but takes." In a perfect
universe, that would be a perfect truth. But men being as they
are, prideful and desirous of any mark of recognition, privileges
are the natural accompaniment of rank and station, and
when not wilfully misused, may contribute to the general wel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>fare.
At all levels, men will aspire more, and their ambition
will be firmer, if getting ahead will mean for them an increase in
the visible tokens of deference from the majority, rather than
simply a boost in the paycheck. To complain about this quality
in human nature is as futile as regretting that the sun goes
down.</p>

<p>However, since it is out of the abuse of privilege that much of
the friction between authority and the rank-and-file arises, the
subject can't be dropped at that point. What puts most of the
grit into the machinery isn't that privileges exist, but that they
are exercised too often by persons who are not motivated by a
passionate sense of duty. For it is an almost inviolable rule of
human behavior that the man who is concerned most of all with
his responsibilities will be fretted least about the matter of his
privileges, and that his exercise of any rightful privilege will not
be resented by his subordinates, because they are conscious of his
merit.</p>

<p>We can take two officers. Lieutenant "A" enters the service
with one main question in mind: "Where does my duty lie?"
So long as he remains on that beam, he will never injure the
morale of the service by using such privileges as are rightfully
his as an officer. But in the mind of Lieutenant "B" the other
idea is uppermost: "What kudos do I get out of my position?"
Unless that man changes his ways, he will be a troublemaker
while he remains in the service, a headache to his fellow officers
and a despoiler of those who are under him.</p>

<p>In recent years, we have learned a lot about American manpower.
We have seen enough of the raw material under testing
conditions to know that, with the exception of the occasional
malcontent who was irreparably spoiled before he left home,
American young men when brought into military organization
do not resent rank, and are amenable to authority. Indeed,
they expect that higher authority will have certain advantages
not common to the rank-and-file, because that is normal in our
society in all of its workday relationships.</p>

<p>But they do not like to have their noses rubbed in it by
officers who, having no real moral claim on authority, try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
exhibit it by pushing other people around. And when that
happens, our men get their backs up. And they wouldn't be
worth a hoot in hades if they didn't.</p>

<p>Even as privilege attends rank and station, it is confirmed by
custom, and modified by time and environment. What was all
right yesterday may be all wrong tomorrow, and what is proper
in one set of circumstances may be wholly wrong in another.</p>

<p>Take one example. In Washington's Continental Army, a first
lieutenant was court-martialed and jailed because he demeaned
himself by doing manual labor with a working detail of his
men. Yet in that same season, Major General von Steuben,
then trainer and inspector of all the forces, created a great
scandal and almost terminated his usefulness by trying to rank
a relatively junior officer out of his quarters. Today both of
these usages seem out of joint. Any officer has the <em>privilege</em> of
working with his men, if he needs exercise, wishes to see for
himself how the thing is done, or feels that an extra hand is
needed on the job at a critical moment. As for any notion that
his quarters are his permanent castle no matter who comes, he
had best not make an issue of the point!</p>

<p>But to emphasize it once again, duty is the great regulator of
the proper exercise of one's rights. Here we speak of duty as it
was meant by Giuseppe Mazzini, Italy's great patriot of the
early Nineteenth Century, when he said: "Every mission constitutes
a pledge of duty. Every man is bound to consecrate his
every effort to its fulfillment. He will derive his rule of action
from the profound conviction of that duty." For finally the key
lies in this, that out of high regard for duty comes as a natural
flow that sense of proportion which we call common sense.</p>

<p>Adjustment and dignity in any situation are impossible when
minds are bent only on a code of conduct rather than on action
which is consistent with the far objectives. In the early stages of
World War II, it was not unusual to see a junior officer walking
on the public sidewalk, hands free, and looking important,
while his wife tagged along, trying to keep step, though laden
like a pack mule. This was because someone had told him that
it was not in keeping with an officer's dignity to be seen heavily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
burdened. In the nature of things, anyone so lacking in gallantry
as that would stimulate very little respect for the officer
corps.</p>

<p>Actually, in these times, there are relatively few special privileges
which attend officership, and though the war brought
perhaps a few excesses, the post war trend has been in the other
direction.</p>

<p>Normally, an officer is not expected to buck a chow line, or
any other queue in line of duty, if he is sensibly in a rush. The
presumption is that his time is more valuable to the service
than that of an enlisted man. Normally, an officer is not expected
to pitch a tent or spend his energy on any hand labor
incidental to housekeeping. Normally, he has greater freedom of
action and is less bound by minor restrictions than the ranks.</p>

<p>But the accent in these things is decidedly on the word
<em>normally</em>. If a mess line were in an area under general fire, so
that added waiting meant extra danger, then only a poltroon
would insist on being fed first. And while an officer wouldn't be
expected to pitch a tent, he would dig his own foxhole, unless
he was well up in grade. At that, there were a few high commanders
in World War II who made it a point of pride to do
their own digging from first to last. Greater "freedom of action,"
too, can go out the window, for conditions arise, particularly
in war, when freedom of action can not be permitted
anyone except the very top authority. When a general restriction
is clamped down, the officer caught violating it is in more
serious jeopardy than the enlisted offender.</p>

<p>As the entire body of this book is directed toward the consideration
of the fundamental responsibilities in officership, the
special comments in this chapter will relate mainly to propositions
not stated elsewhere.</p>

<p>Though it has been said before, even so, it can be said
again: It is a paramount and overriding responsibility of every
officer to take care of his men before caring for himself. From
the frequent and gross violation of this principle by badly informed
or meanly selfish individuals comes more embarrassment
to officer-man relationships than perhaps from all other causes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
put together. <em>It is a cardinal principle!</em> Yet many junior
officers do not seem to understand that steadfast fidelity to it is
required, not lip service. "And of this," as Admiral Mahan
would say, "comes much evil." The loyalty of men simply cannot
be commanded when they become embittered by selfish
action.</p>

<p>Then how deeply does this rule cut? In line of duty, it applies
right down to the hilt! When a command is worn, bruised, and
hungry, officers attend to their men's creature comforts and
make sure that all is going well, before looking to their own
needs. If an officer is on a tour with an enlisted man, he takes
care that the man is accommodated as to food, shelter, medical
treatment or other prime needs, before satisfying his own wants;
if that means that the last meal or the last bed is gone, his duty
is to get along the hard way. If a command is so located that
recreational facilities are extremely limited, and there are not
enough to go around, the welfare of the ranks takes priority
over the interests of their commissioned leaders; in fact, it
would be more correct to say that the welfare of men <em>is</em> the
prior interest of the officer.</p>

<p>These few concrete illustrations show, in general, what is expected.
Once the main idea is grasped, the way of its total
application becomes clear. Officers do not go around playing
pigtail to enlisted men. But they build loyalty by serving the
men first, when all concerned are following a general line of
duty together.</p>

<p>It is an incumbent responsibility on all officers to maintain the
dignity of the uniform and prevent anyone from sullying it.
This means not only the dress of person, but the uniform wherever
it is worn publicly by any man of the United States forces.
Where the offense is committed by a member of some other
service and the disgrace to the uniform is obvious, it is the
duty of the officer to intervene, or to bring about intervention,
rather than to walk out on the situation. This calls for judgment,
tact, nerve. The offense must be real, and not simply an
offense against one's private sensibilities. But indecencies, exhibitionism
and bawdiness of such a nature that if done on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
reservation would warrant trial of the individual for unbecoming
conduct will justify intervention by the officer under public
circumstances.</p>

<p>Similarly, any officer has a responsibility to any enlisted man
who is in personal distress, with no other means of ready help.
Suppose they just happen to meet in a strange community. The
enlisted man's credentials are shown to be <em>bona fide</em>. But he has
had his pocket picked, or has lost his wallet, or has just missed
the train that would have carried him back from his leave on
time, and he doesn't know what to do. For any officer to
brush-off a forthright request for aid or advice under such circumstances
is an unofficerly act. Likewise, if one suspects, just
from appearances, that the man is in trouble and somewhat
beyond his depths, it will be found that, far from resenting a
kindly inquiry, he will mark it to the credit of the whole fighting
system.</p>

<p>To say that an officer owes a fellow officer no less consideration
than this is to state the obvious. Officers meeting in
transit usually get into conversation; it is a habit that adds
much to one's professional education. When an officer is getting
into a strange town, or arriving at a new post, anything done
by a fellow officer to help him get oriented, or to make things
friendly and easy for him, furthers the comity of the corps.
Between officers of differing services these small courtesies are
particularly appreciated. Nor does the matter end there. Within
Unit A, the officers have the responsibility of continuing support
to the officers of Unit C, Unit B, and so on. Though they are in
a sense competing, each trying to build higher than the other,
they must never forget that the basic technique of organization
is cooperation. What "A" knows that has helped his unit, or
whatever he can do to assist "B" and "C" without materially
depriving himself, it becomes his official and moral obligation to
transmit. An officer can never understand his own command
problem very well unless he knows, at least a little, of how
things are going in other units. And the statement can be reversed.
He cannot judge the problems of other people unless
he tries passionately to understand his own people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>There are many other minor articles within what is sometimes
called the "unwritten code" which help to regulate life in
the services, and to sweeten it.</p>

<p>But what counts most is not the knowing of the rule but the
sharing of the spirit which gives it meaning and makes its
proper administration possible.</p>

PLANNING YOUR CAREER</h3>


<p>The main purpose of this book is to stimulate thought and to
encourage the average young officer to seek truth for, and in,
himself. It is never a good idea to attempt a precise formula
about matters which are by nature indefinite and subject to all
number of variable factors.</p>

<p>Thus with respect to career planning, despite all of the emphasis
put upon that subject in modern America, it would be
plain error to infer that any man can become all-wise, as to the
direction which he should take with his own life, simply by
steeping himself in all of the information which is to be had on
this subject.</p>

<p>That might qualify him to give top-lofty advice to all others
on how to make the start up the right ladder, and he would
win a reputation as a personnel expert, which in itself is no
mean assignment. But in all probability, he would still be doing
better by himself than by any other individual.</p>

<p>American library shelves are stacked with such books as
"Planning Your Future," "New Careers for Youth," and "The
Problem of Vocational Guidance." The pages are laden with
sage counsel and bromidic expressions. But their chief public
value is that they enabled a writer, his publisher and the bookseller
to get a little further ahead in life.</p>

<p>Reflecting the trend elsewhere in the national life, the Armed
Services are equipped to give their forces the advantage of career
management principles, and to assist their men to plan their
professional careers. The opportunities and the job qualifications
can be described. Also, somewhat more thoroughly than is
done in civil life, the establishment's system of record-keeping
throws a partial light on the aptitudes of the individual. The
qualified man is soon known by his "spec number" or maybe
two numbers. It might seem therefore that things are so well-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>regulated
that the prospect of every man finding his niche is
better than even.</p>

<p>The fact remains that the majority of individuals spend the
greater part of their lives doing something other than that which
would bring out their best quality and give them the greatest
satisfaction, mainly because accident, in one form or another,
put them into a particular channel, and inertia kept them there.</p>

<p>A boy builds model airplanes. His hobby being a force in his
youthful years, he becomes a pilot, and then discovers to his
shocked amazement that he does not have his heart in machines
but in the management of men. A man who has lived his life
among guns, and who enjoys the feel and the working of them,
enters the service and permits himself to be made a food procurement
specialist, having run that kind of business in civil
life only because he had inherited it from his father. An
officer assigned to a weapons detail finds it hard going. And the
fact that he takes a delight in writing a good paper still does
not signal to him that this is his main field and he should
exploit it to the fullest!</p>

<p>To what do these things point? In particular, to this, that
despite all of the help which may be provided by outside
agencies, finding the straight thoroughfare in work is mainly a
problem of searching self-examination and personal decision.
The impression which any other person may have of our talents
and possibilities is largely formed by what we say, think and
feel about ourselves.</p>

<p>This does not require that constant introspection which is
found in Cecil Forester's nervous hero, "Captain Horatio Hornblower."
That man doubtless would have died of stomach ulcers
before winning his second stripe. It is not a matter of, "How do
I look to someone else?" but of, "What do I know about myself?"
The kind of work which one likes best and does with the
greatest facility, the avocational study which is pursued because
it provides greater delight than an encharged responsibility,
the talent which one had as a youth but was dropped
because of the press of making a living, the task which looks
alluring though one has lacked either the chance, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
courage, to try a hand at it&mdash;these are among the more
fertile points of inquiry.</p>

<p>Weighing it out, the service officer has an unrivaled opportunity
for fruitful experiment.</p>

<p>In the first place, he has made the fundamental decision to
serve his country in the profession of arms. The meaning of
that decision should not be lost on him. It is by nature patriotic.
But if he regards his inheritance simply as a snug berth and
the best way to provide "three squares" to himself and family
throughout a lifetime, he is neither soundly patriotic nor intelligently
selfish.</p>

<p>After signing on the line for his country, the individual's duty
to himself is to strive by every honorable means to move ahead
of his competition by growing more knowledgeable and better
qualified. <em>It is the inherent right of every officer to request such
service as he believes will further his advancement</em>, and far
from discouraging the ambitious man, higher authority will invariably
try to favor him. In no other mode of life are older
men so ready to encourage the willing junior.</p>

<p>Gen. H. H. Arnold, the great air leader of World War II, is
an inspiring case study with respect to several of these points.
He wrote in "Global Mission" how he considered quitting the
Army in disgust upon being commissioned in infantry, following
graduation, so deeply was his heart set upon service in cavalry.
But something held him to the assignment. Some years later he
tried to transfer to ordnance because the prospect for advancement
looked better. While still ruminating on this change, he
was offered a detail to the newly forming aviation section of the
signal corps, and took it, not because he had a clear vision of
the future, but because it looked like a chance to get ahead.
Thus, almost inadvertently, he met the opportunity of which
came his world fame.</p>

<p>This emphasizes another peculiar advantage belonging to the
young officer who is trying to orient himself toward the line of
greatest opportunity. In civil life, the man who flits from job to
job is soon regarded as a drifter and unstable. In the military
establishment an ability to adjust from job to job and to achieve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
greater all-around qualification by making a successful record
in a diversified experience becomes a major asset in a career.
Generalship, in its real sense, requires a wider knowledge of
human affairs, supported by specialized knowledge of professional
techniques, than any other great responsibility. Those who
get to the top have to be many-sided men, with skill in the
control and guidance of a multifarious variety of activities.
Therefore even the young specialist, who has his eyes on a narrow
track because his talents seem to lie in that direction, is
well advised to raise his sights and extend his interest to the far
horizons of the profession, even while directing the greater part
of his force to a particular field.</p>

<p>After all, variety is the spice of life, as well as a high road
toward perfection. Of Princeton's 1932 class, 161, or 59 percent,
were in the armed services during World War II. Questioned
after the war 70 percent of the total number replied that military
service was interesting, broadening, and profitable. But the
main point was that they said in overwhelming number that its
great lure was that <em>they were doing something new</em>. They liked
it because it gave them a legitimate excuse to quit their jobs and
attempt something different. In the services, a man may give
vent to this natural desire without impairing his record, and if
he is young and not at all certain what is his favorite dish,
the more he broadens his experience, the more likely it becomes
that he will sharpen his view of his own capabilities.</p>

<p>The possible hard consequence of looking at service opportunity
through any one lens is epitomized in one paragraph of a
reclassification proceedings on an officer relieved during World
War II while serving as assistant division commander:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Through no fault of his own, General Blank has never served
with troops since he was a captain during World War I. He
has been unable to keep pace with the problems of a commander
on the battlefield of today. He is unqualified for command of
troops due to lack of practical experience."</p></div>

<p>It is hard to imagine a more dismal ending for a career than
that of the man who aspires to rank, without having any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
honest concept of its proportionate moral responsibilities, particularly
when the lives of others are at stake.</p>

<p>So when we say that "career planning" is a springboard to
personal success within the military establishment, it is not with
the narrow meaning that any officer should proceed to limit his
field of interest, decide quickly and arbitrarily where he will put
his plow and run his furrow, and then sit down and plot a
schedule of how he proposes to mount the success ladder rung
by rung. That might suit a plumber, or tickle the fancy of an interior
decorator, but it will not conserve the strength of the
officer corps. Its consequence would be to stereotype the thinking
faculties of a professional whose inner power flows from the
questing imagination, eager curiosity and versatility of its individuals.
Intense specialization, to the exclusion of all peripheral
areas of knowledge, warps the mind and limits the useful action
and influence of its owner. Dr. Vannevar Bush was a greater
scientist on the day he made his decision to explore the sphere
of military knowledge, and greater still when he applied himself
to literature.</p>

<p>There are few men of great talent who initially have an unswerving
inner conviction that they possess the final answer,
as to themselves. They may feel reasonably sure about what they
would like to do, though still reserving an honest doubt about
the validity of their instincts and of their power to compete.
Even long and successful experience does not always allay this
doubt. Said Washington, on being appointed Commander-in-Chief:
"I beg it may be remembered by every man in this room
that I this day declare with the utmost sincerity, I do not think
myself equal to the command I am honored with." Assurance,
or by its other name, self-confidence, is only a continuing willingness
to keep coming back and trying, without fear of coming
a cropper, but with a care to the constant strengthening of one's
own resources. The motto of Admiral Robert E. Peary: "I will
find a way or make one," is not over-bold; any officer can
afford to paste the words inside his own hat. But in the hard
game with which Peary's fame is forever linked, there were
countless errors, an occasional hit, and at last a run.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>The health and progressive spirit of the services come of the
many-sided officer who can make not one career for himself but
three or four. Had officers from all services been unwilling to go
into the industrial workshops and scientific laboratories of the
Nation to try their hands at wholly new lines of work, had
successful cavalrymen been unable to evolve as leaders of
armored forces, had ship captains and ensigns disdained taking
to the air, had foot soldiers refused the risks of parachuting and
naval officers not participated as observers with the infantry
line to further SFC (ship fire control) we would have run out
of wind before winning World War II.</p>

<p>Some months after the war ended, the Secretary of the Navy,
recognizing the dilemma which confronted thousands of men
who were asking whether the wave of the future would be to
the specialist or to the all-around man, sent a message which
applied not less to the officers of every service:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is intended that the highest posts will be filled by officers
of the highest attainments, regardless of specialty. Be assured,
whatever may be your field of endeavor, that your future as an
officer rests, as it always has, in your hands. The outstanding
officer will continue to be he who attacks with all of his energy
and enthusiasm the tasks to which he is assigned and who grows
in stature and understanding with his years and with his experience.
Responsibility comes to him who seeks responsibility.
It is this officer, regardless of his field of effort, who will be called
to high command.</p></div>

<p>There is not a chief of service who would shade the general
tone of this paragraph if asked to put before his own officers
the one rule which, most closely followed, would most surely
bring success. Nothing need be added to it and nothing should
be taken away; it states the case.</p>

<p>At the same time, and as the message itself implies, specialization,
like sex and the automobile, is here to stay. In the service,
perforce, even the balanced, all-around man has his specialty.
In the beginning, true enough, he may aspire only to being a
soldier, marine, sailor or airman. That is good enough in the
cocoon stage. But ultimately he emerges with the definite color<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>ing
of a ground fighter, a gunner, an engineer officer, a signals
man, a submariner, a weapons man, a navigator, an observer, a
transport officer or something else. If his tact, bearing and quick
pick-up suggest to his superiors that he may be good staff
material, and he takes that route, there are again branch lines,
leading out in roughly parallel directions, and embracing activities
in the fields of personnel, intelligence, operations, supply
and military government. And each one of these main stems has
smaller branches, greatly diversified. The man with a love for
logistics (and few have it) might some day find himself
running railroads or managing a port. The engineer could become
a salvage officer working a crew of deep sea divers, or as
easily a demolitions expert running a company of dynamiters.
The expert in communications? His next task might be setting
up a radio station near the North Pole or helping perfect radio
control of troops over a 50-mile area.</p>

<p>It is in these things that the privilege of free choice arises,
for despite the popular theory that in the services you take what
you are given and like it, the placement of officers according to
their main aptitudes and desires is a controlling principle of
personnel policy. It is recognized throughout the military establishment
that, in general, men will do their best service in that
field where they think their natural talents are being most usefully
employed.</p>

<p>Among the combat line commanders in World War II there
were doctors, dentists and even a few ministers. They could have
had places in their regular corps, but they were permitted to
continue with the duty of their own choice.</p>

<p>Concerning the main problem of the officer, in fitting himself
for higher command, the controlling principle is well expressed
in the words of a distinguished educator, Wallace B. Donham:
"The hope of the wisdom essential to the general direction of
men's affairs lies not so much in wealth of specialized knowledge
as in the habits and skills required to handle problems involving
very diverse viewpoints which must be related to new concrete
situations. Wisdom is based on broad understanding in perspective.
It is common sense on a large canvas. It is never the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
product of scientific, technological, or other specializations,
though men so trained may, of course, acquire it."</p>

<p>This puts just the right light on the subject. The military
officer specializes strictly to qualify himself more highly in his
main calling&mdash;the management of men in the practice of arms.
Becoming a specialist does not <em>ipso facto</em> make him a better
officer, or win him preferment. It is part of the mechanism,
though not the main wheel. As Admiral Forrest P. Sherman has
so well said: "We are not pushed willy-nilly into specialization;
there is never an excess of the all-around, highly competent
combat officer."</p>

<p>Concerning his choice, all general advice is gratuitous. Whatever
might be written here would be worth far less than the
counsel or suggestion of any superior, or for that matter, a colleague,
who has observed his work closely over a long period,
who has some critical faculty, and whose good will is beyond
question.</p>

<p>Particularly, the <em>voluntary</em> advice of such a person is worth
notice. That which is spontaneous usually has shrewd reason behind
it. When counsel is deliberately sought, it may catch the
consultant unaware, and in lieu of saying that which is well-considered,
he may offer a half-baked opinion, rather than be
disappointing. But when another person having one's trust, says:
"Your natural line is to do thus-and-so," it is time to ask him
why, and check his reasoning with one's own. Worth just as
much earnest consideration is his negative opinion, his strong
feeling that what one is about to undertake is not particularly
suitable.</p>

<p>As for the man himself, it remains to survey thoughtfully the
whole range of possibilities, to keep the mind open and receptive
to impressions, to experiment but take firm hold in so doing, to
tackle each new task with as much enthusiasm as if it were to be
his life work, to ask for difficult assignments rather than soft
snaps and to be calmly deliberate, rather than rashly hasteful, in
appraising his own capabilities.</p>

<p>Self-study is a lifetime job. A great many engineers didn't
realize that they were born to make nuclear fission possible until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
there was a three-way wedding between science, industry and
the military in 1940. Many officers who have had a late blooming
as experts in the field of electronics and supersonic speeds
had lived out successful careers before these subjects first saw
daylight.</p>

<p>As Elbert Hubbard said of it, the only way to get away from
opportunity is to lie down and die.</p>

RANK AND PRECEDENCE</h3>


<p>The regulations that govern precedence among officers of the
same service and among the services in relation to each other
have a very real utility not only in determining succession to
command and as reminders of the authority to which all persons
in the Armed Services are subject but in providing precedent for
all official or ceremonial occasions in which officers or organizations
of the several services may find themselves cooperating.
It is easy to imagine the confusion that would result without
such rules, especially if a junior commander of a senior service
had to defend the right of his organization to occupy the place
of honor ahead of a very senior commander with a detachment
from a junior service. These regulations are also the arbiter in
disputes arising between officers of equal rank who aspire to
command of the same unit.</p>

<p>The legislation which separated the Air Force from the Army
again raised the question of precedence in parades and ceremonies.
Since the Air Force is the junior service, as to date
of recognition, the change indicated the following parade order:
(Reference, <em>Federal Register</em>, Volume 14, Number 160, August
19, 1949, page 5203)</p>


<ol>
<li>Cadets, United States Military Academy.</li>

<li>Midshipmen, United States Naval Academy.</li>

<li>Cadets, United States Coast Guard Academy.</li>

<li>United States Army.</li>

<li>United States Marines.</li>

<li>United States Navy.</li>

<li>United States Air Force.</li>

<li>United States Coast Guard.</li>

<li>National Guard of the United States.</li>

<li>Organized Reserve Corps of the Army.</li>

<li>Marine Corps Reserve.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Naval Reserve.</li>

<li>Air Force National Guard of the United States.</li>

<li>United States Air Force Reserve.</li>

<li>Coast Guard Reserve.</li>

<li>Other training organizations of the Army, Marine
Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, in that
order, respectively.</li>
</ol>

<p>During any period when the United States Coast Guard shall
operate as a part of the United States Navy, the Cadets,
United States Coast Guard Academy, the United States Coast
Guard, and the Coast Guard Reserve, shall take precedence,
respectively, next after the Midshipmen, United States Naval
Academy, the United States Navy, and the Naval Reserve.</p>

<p>In any ceremony in which any or all of these components act
together, the table of precedence in appropriate regulations
determines their location in the column.</p>

<p>The ranks and insignia in the Armed Services have been substantially
the same since 1883. During World War II there were
newly established the five star ranks of general of the army and
fleet admiral. After the first World War the rank of general-of-the-armies
was created to honor General Pershing, who was permitted
to choose the number of stars he would wear. He chose
four. After the Spanish-American War the rank of admiral-of-the-navy
was established for Admiral Dewey. No one has held
this rank since.</p>

<p>On November 15, 1776, Congress established the ranks of admiral,
vice-admiral, rear admiral and commodore corresponding
to general, lieutenant general, major general, and brigadier
general. It also established three grades of naval captains&mdash;captain
of a 40-gun ship and upward to rank with colonel, captain
of a 20 to 40-gun ship to rank with lieutenant colonel, captain
of a 10 to 20-gun ship to rank with major, and lieutenant to
rank with captain in the Army.</p>

<p>Although the top naval ranks were provided, the only two
officers ever to attain a higher rank than captain prior to 1862
were Ezekiel Hopkins, whom Congress on December 22, 1775,
commissioned with the rank of <em>C-in-C of the Fleet</em>, and Charles
Stewart who was commissioned <em>Senior Flag Officer</em> by Congress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in 1859. Hopkins and Stewart were called "commodore" as was
any other captain who commanded more than one ship.</p>

<p>During our War of Independence, the Army had the rank of
ensign and the Navy did not. The several Army ranks were then
distinguishable by the color of the cockade, green for lieutenant,
buff for captain, and pink or red for a field officer. As early as
1780 major generals wore two stars on their epaulettes and
brigadier generals one. During our quasi-war with France, toward
the end of the eighteenth century, Washington was commissioned
lieutenant general, our first, and three stars were
prescribed to be worn by him.</p>

<p>In the Army Register for 1813 the rank of ensign had disappeared
but there were third lieutenants (as in the Soviet Army
today) and coronets. In 1832 the eagle was adopted as the insignia
of colonel in the Army and in 1857 the lieutenant colonel,
captain, and first lieutenant wore the same insignia as today.
These insignia were adopted some time in the interval between
1847 and 1857. The gold bar, insigne of the second lieutenant,
was authorized just prior to World War I.</p>

<p>The Navy has used the same shoulder insignia as the Army
since the Civil War. However, shoulder insignia on blues were
discontinued by the Navy in 1911 but the insignia were still
prescribed on epaulettes. The Navy adopted the eagle for captain
in 1852, twenty years after it had been approved by the
Army for colonels.</p>

<p>In the first half of the last century the Navy List contained
officers of four grades only. A captain wore three stripes, a master
commandant, two (master commandant, established in 1806,
was changed to commander in 1837;) and a lieutenant, one.
A master had no stripe but three buttons instead. There were
midshipmen too, but they were warrant officers and <em>aspirants</em>
for commissioned rank as the present French term designates
them.</p>

<p>Our first full general was U. S. Grant and our first full admiral,
David D. Porter; both won their rank in the Civil War.
In that war there was a large increase in the Navy and more
naval ranks were established. In 1862 ensign was provided in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Navy to correspond to second lieutenant; and the term lieutenant
commanding became lieutenant commander. An ensign
wore one stripe as now; an additional stripe was added for each
rank till the rear admiral had eight. Since 1869 the senior
officers have worn the same stripes as now prescribed. In 1883
the rank "master" was changed to lieutenant, junior grade.</p>

<p>The rank of commodore, which had been abolished, was
temporarily revived during World War II. The rank of passed-midshipman
was abolished about 1910; thereafter graduates of
the Naval Academy were commissioned ensign. The rank of
ensign had previously been attained by passed-midshipmen after
2 years at sea and a successful examination at the end of that
cruise. The only permanent change in recent years was the addition
of aviation cadet to both the Air Force and Navy listings.
The warrant rank of flight officer in the Air Force, which was
created during the war, has now been abandoned, all the flight
officers then holding warrants either being commissioned second
lieutenants or separated. The naval rank of commodore was
likewise dropped, and brigadier generals of the Army and Air
Force now rank with admirals of the lower half.</p>

<p>The following are the present corresponding ranks in the
Armed Services:</p>

<p>Officers of all the fighting service, whether regular or reserve,
take precedence among themselves according to their dates of
rank. Officers take command in their respective services in accordance
with their dates of rank in the line, the senior, unless
otherwise ordered, taking command, whether regular or reserve.
The command of a task force or group composed of commands
from two or more services devolves upon the senior commanding
officer present in the force or group unless otherwise designated
by the appropriate common senior, acting for the President.</p>

<p>The obvious exceptions to this are that officers outside the line
(that is, commissioned in specialized branches or corps) cannot
command line organizations. They may, however, in the Army
and Air Force, command organizations within the structure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
their own corps. Non-rated officers in the Air Force and Navy
are not eligible to command tactical flying units. As a specialized
case of command, the assigned first pilot and airplane commander
of any aircraft continues in command even though a
pilot senior in rank may be aboard.</p>

<p>Retired officers of the Army rank at the foot of active officers
of the same grade; those of the Navy according to date of rank.</p>

<p>Changing personnel policies have been reflected by frequent
revisions of the scale and grade given noncommissioned leadership.
This subject should therefore be checked against current
regulations. But as a rough guide, the following can be taken
as the corresponding noncommissioned grades and rates in the
services:</p>

the outer garment. Army chevrons are worn on both sleeves with
the point up, and special devices may be incorporated within
the chevron to indicate specialties. Chevrons for combat soldiers
are blue on a gold background, and all others are gold on a
blue background. Naval chevrons are worn point down. Air
Force chevrons have no point, but are a compound reverse
curve with the deepest part of the curve worn down; over this
is imposed a star within a circle. Marine Corps chevrons are
worn on both sleeves with the point up and are gold on a
crimson background for the dress blue uniform, green on a
red background for the forest green uniform, green on a khaki
background for the khaki uniform, and for combat uniforms
the chevrons are stenciled on the sleeves in black ink.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Except when in the presence of troops, senior officers frequently
address juniors as "Smith" or "Jones" but this does not
give the junior the privilege of addressing the senior in any
other way than his proper title. By the same token, officers of
the same grade generally address one another by their first or
last names depending on the degree of intimacy. The courtesy
and respect for others which govern the conduct of gentlemen
are expected to prevail at all times.</p>

<p>Enlisted men are commonly addressed by their last names.
Except in cases where the officer has a blood relationship or a
preservice friendship with an enlisted man, the occasions on
which an enlisted man can properly be called by his first name
are extremely rare. Speaking face to face, it is proper to use
either the last name, alone, or the title of rank, or the last name
and any accepted abbreviation of the title. In calling First
Sergeant Brown from among a group, it would be acceptable to
call for "Brown" but better still "Sergeant Brown." In the Navy,
the common practice in addressing Chief Pharmacists Mate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Gale, for instance, would be either "Gale" or "Chief." On formal
occasions, as in calling a senior enlisted man front and center
at a formation, the full military title would be used: "Chief
Bo's'ns Mate Gale and Master Sergeant Brown, front and center."
The longer form of address would also be proper in directing
a third party to report to Master Sergeant White.</p>

<p>A painstaking observation of the courtesies due to ranks of
other services is more than a sign of good manners; it indicates a
recognition of the interdependence of the services upon one
another. Failure to observe or to recognize the tables of precedence
officially agreed upon among the services is both stupid
and rude. Any future war will see joint operations on a scale
never before achieved, and its success will be dependent in
large part upon the cooperation of all ranks in all services.
Likewise, in combined operations, the alert officer will take it
upon himself to learn and respect the insignia, relative ranks,
and customs of his Allies. By exerting himself in the recognition
of other ranks, by exacting adherence to the official tables of precedence,
he contributes not only to his own stature as a professional
soldier, sailor, marine or airman, but adds to the
reputation of his service.</p>

<p>In the main requirements, military courtesy varies but little
from nation to nation. During service abroad, an American
officer will salute the commissioned officers and pay respects to
the anthems and colors of friendly nations just as to those of his
own country.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_SIX" id="CHAPTER_SIX"></a><span class="chapter_number">CHAPTER SIX</span><br /><br />

CUSTOMS AND COURTESIES</h3>


<p>Mutual respect and courtesy are indispensable elements in
military organization. The junior shows deference to the senior;
the senior shows consideration for him. The salute is the ancient
and universal privilege of fighting men. It is a recognition of a
common fellowship in a proud profession. Saluting is an expression
of courtesy, alertness, and discipline. The senior is as
obliged to return it as the junior is to initiate it. In fact, in the
Army particularly, it is not unusual to see the senior salute first.
Interservice salutes should be exchanged as punctiliously as between
members of a single service, for both services stand to
gain or lose by the manner in which this act is performed.</p>

<p>The general rules governing saluting are based on common
sense, good manners, and the customs of the times. For instance,
soldiers actively engaged in sports are not required to salute, nor
is any man leading a horse, since the sudden motion so near
the horse's head might make it restive. There will always be
occasions when it is inconvenient, impractical, or illogical to
render or require the return of a salute. The intent of the regulation
is not that it embarrass or demean the individual, but that
it serve as a signal of recognition and greeting between members
of the military brotherhood. According to regulations, in all
services, the salute is initiated by the junior, and at any convenient
distance that insures recognition, the least being about
six paces. The form of the salute is the same in the Army, Navy
and Air Force, and it is given either from the position of attention
or at a walk. It is not given indoors except when reporting
to another officer in an official capacity. In the Navy, it is customary
for the junior initiating a salute to combine it with "Good
morning, Sir," as a means of reinforcing its meaning as a greeting.
Where this is done in the other two services, it is usually the
result of a local directive expressing the wish of a particular
commander. While it is expected that the junior will initiate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
such a greeting, there is no obligation upon him to do so, nor is
there any reason that the senior may not say it first.</p>

<p>The Navy and Air Force require that the junior, when engaged
in work that brings him in reasonably frequent contact
with the same seniors during the course of the working day,
salute each senior officer the first time that he is passed during
the day, but not subsequently unless a change in circumstances
requires it. In the Air Force an enlisted mechanic working on the
line would salute the engineering officer and his assistants the
first time he recognized them during the day. If he passed one of
the same officers later in the day, for example in front of the
post exchange, he would salute again. The Army requires that a
salute be given and returned each time the junior passes the
senior, unless circumstances dictate that it be temporarily suspended
by common agreement. The Commanding Officer of a
naval vessel is saluted whenever met.</p>

<p>Salutes are not mandatory on the driver of a vehicle, whether
moving or idling at the curb, for the reason that the operator is
presumed to need both hands for driving. Salutes are not exchanged
between moving vehicles, between moving and halted
vehicles, or between persons walking and persons riding in official
cars except when it is obvious that the passenger is a senior,
or when it is required as part of a ceremony. Official vehicles
carrying general officers or flag officers will be clearly marked
outside, and will be saluted. A salute is exchanged between
persons in a parked vehicle and persons walking, unless the car
is a bus or taxi. When two boats pass each other, the senior
officer in each boat salutes without rising.</p>

<p>Aside from saluting, there are certain other customs that govern
conduct around official vehicles. Since the place of honor is
on the right, the junior not only walks on the left, but rides
there as well. In entering a car, the junior enters first, followed
by other members of the party in inverse order of rank, each
seating himself so that the senior may take position on the right
side. In leaving the car, the senior debarks first. However, if
following this general procedure would necessitate any member<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the party climbing over another, or in any other way cause an
awkward situation, the senior may enter first and alight last.</p>

<p>The same rules govern for boarding and leaving small boats,
except that the junior rides forward and the senior aft.</p>

<p>In boarding aircraft with a single hatch, the pilot enters first,
followed by the copilot and other members of the crew. With the
crew in place, other passengers enter according to rank, the
senior first; he takes the seat of his choice if the aircraft is
equipped with seats. In either transport or tactical aircraft, the
senior officers generally ride as far forward as possible. In leaving
the aircraft, the aircrew who handle deplaning normally leave
first, followed by passengers in order of seniority.</p>

<p>The long association of the Air Force with the Army precludes
any large body of custom and tradition that can be called
peculiarly Air Force in origin or usage. In time undoubtedly a
considerable body of distinctive official and social courtesies
will grow, but at present most of the official and unofficial
usages given here for the Army are understood to be applicable
to the Air Force as well, and will be so treated.</p>

<p>The hand salute is required on all military installations and in
occupied territories, whether on or off duty; in all official greeting
in the line of duty both on and off the base; for ceremonial
occasions; and in honoring the National Anthem, or color, or
distinguished persons.</p>

<p>Since most military posts or bases are guarded on a twenty-four
hour basis, the first official contact will be with the guard
on the main gate. He may be a soldier or airman selected by
roster and under the temporary control of the Officer of the
Day, a Military Policeman wearing an MP brassard and under
the command of the Provost Marshal, or a civilian guard either
under the Provost or some other special staff agency of the Post
or Base Commander. On the ordinary post or base, officers of
other services will be admitted if wearing uniform, even when
accompanied by civilian dependents. If the stay is of short duration,
a "visitors" tag on the car may be sufficient; in other cases
it may be necessary to secure a temporary pass from the Provost.</p>

<p>Except for civilian guards, who do not salute, and who will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
readily identified in their police uniforms, the guard, if armed
with a pistol or carbine will give a hand salute. During the hours
for challenging (usually extending from a short time before darkness
until after reveille the next morning) sentries on an Army
post may require any officer to halt, give his rank and name, and
advance for recognition. The challenging sentry stands at "raise
pistol" or "port arms" until the challenged party has been
recognized, after which he simply returns his weapon to the
normal carrying position; if armed with a rifle, he executes
"present arms" and holds it until the salute is returned.</p>

<p>On any post or base, the adjutant usually acts for the commanding
officer in greeting the visitor and directing him to the
various facilities of the base, although if the visit is to be of
short duration&mdash;say, just for the purpose of seeing a friend&mdash;it
would be impertinent to bother him. But if the visiting officer
is reporting for temporary duty, or if he will be living in the
immediate vicinity for some time on special detail and desires
the use of post facilities, he is required to report to the adjutant.</p>

<p>Most posts and bases have not only a bachelor officers quarters,
more popularly known by the abbreviation BOQ, where the
visitor may obtain lodging, but also a Hostess House where the
officer may stay with his dependents. These accommodations are
usually under the supervision of the Billeting Officer, who makes
the assignments and charges a nominal fee for the services provided.
Other facilities that the visitor may use include the
Officer's Club and dining room, the Post Exchange (corresponding
to Navy Exchanges), and the post theater. Under certain
conditions the visitor may secure permission from the adjutant
or executive to make purchases at the Commissary, which deals
in foodstuffs and other perishables.</p>

<p>Special dinners are served to the enlisted men on Christmas,
Thanksgiving, July 4, New Year's Day and sometimes on February
22. The company commander and lieutenants of the company
accompanied by their wives and families and other guests
visit the dining room and kitchen just before Christmas dinner
is served, often remaining for dinner as guests of the organization.
In some companies the soldiers are permitted to invite their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
wives and other ladies to dinner. In some commands, the post
commander accompanied by his staff and some of the ladies of
the garrison visit all the dining rooms and kitchens just previous
to dinner hour.</p>

<p>A newly arrived officer on a post and the adult members of
his family are usually invited to be in the receiving line at the
first regimental function after their arrival.</p>

<p>If you arrive at a post at which you expect to remain longer
than 24 hours you should check with the post adjutant for rules
on calling. The adjutant will also give the normal calling hours
in effect at the post or station. You are usually expected to call
on the post commander. If assigned to duty there, you would
normally call on all of your intermediate commanders at their
offices. These calls should be made immediately after the call
on the post commander. If unable to wear uniform, an explanation
should be made for appearing in civilian clothes.</p>

<p>When it is in keeping with local rules, as verified by the adjutant,
you should follow the official visit by a social call on the
post and intermediate commanders at their residence within 72
hours after your arrival. If the commander is married and his
wife is present on the post, it is customary for you to make the
visit accompanied by your wife. These calls should be formal
and ordinarily last no longer than fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>You need not make other calls until the officers of the battalion,
regiment or garrison have called on you except that as
junior officer you should make the first call on field officers of
your organization.</p>

<p>It is customary for all officers of a unit or garrison to call
upon the commanding officer on New Year's Day. (Again the
commanding officer's desire in this matter can be asked of his
aide or adjutant.)</p>

<p>The visitor at the average Army and Air Force post will
probably see few ceremonies other than retreat. This ceremony,
which closes the official day, may be accompanied either by
appropriate bugle calls, or by a parade with a military band. In
the former case, the music will sound <em>To the Color</em>, and in the
latter, the <em>National Anthem</em>, while the flag is being lowered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Retreat is held daily at a fixed time, usually about 1700 hours.
Posts with saluting cannon fire one round at the designated
hour. At the first note of either the <em>National Anthem</em> or <em>To the
Color</em>, all dismounted persons face toward the color or flag and
render the prescribed salute from attention; the salute is held
until the last note of the music has been played. In the event the
flag cannot be seen and the location of the flag staff is unknown
to the person saluting, he faces toward the sound of the music.</p>

<p>At parades and reviews and on other occasions when uncased
colors are carried, all military personnel salute at six paces
distance and hold the salute until the color or standard is the
same distance past. When personal honors are being rendered to
general or flag officers at a review, all military personnel present
and not in formation salute during the ruffles, flourishes, and
march. When a cannon salute is given, personnel in the immediate
vicinity conform to the actions of the person being saluted.
No salute is required during the 48 gun salute to the Nation on
the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>Military personnel also salute during the passing of a caisson
or hearse in a military funeral. If attending the services at the
grave side either as mourners or as honorary pallbearers, they
stand at attention with the head-dress over the left breast at any
time the casket is being moved, and during the service at the
grave, including the firing of the volleys and the sounding of
<em>Taps</em>. In cold or inclement weather, the head-dress is left on
and the hand salute is rendered during the movement of the
casket, the firing of the volleys, and the sound of <em>Taps</em>.</p>

<p>On ships having 180 or more men of the seaman branch, the
side is attended by side boys for visiting officers of our Armed
Services, except in civilian clothes, and for officers of the Foreign
Service when they come on board and depart. This courtesy
is also extended to commissioned officers of the armed services of
foreign nations. Officers of the rank of lieutenant to major inclusive
are given two side boys, from lieutenant colonel to colonel
four side boys, from brigadier to major general six side boys, and
lieutenant general and above eight side boys. Full guard and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
band are given to general officers, and for a colonel the guard
of the day but no music.</p>

<p>During the hours of darkness or low visibility an approaching
boat is usually hailed "Boat ahoy?" which corresponds to the
sentry's challenge, "Who goes there?" Some of the answers are as
follows:</p>

<div id="challenge_table">

</div>

<p>Similarly if the CO of the 13th Infantry is embarked or the CO
of Fortress Monroe, the answers would be "13th Infantry" or
"Fort Monroe."</p>

<p>On arrival, at the order, "Tend the side" the side boys fall
in fore and aft of the approach to the gangway, facing each
other. The boatswain's mate-of-the-watch takes station forward
of them and faces aft. When the boat comes alongside the
boatswain's mate pipes, and again when the visiting officer's
head reaches the level of the deck. At this moment the side boys
salute.</p>

<p>On departure, the ceremony is repeated in reverse, the bo's'ns
mate begins to pipe and the side boys salute as soon as the departing
officer steps toward the gangway between the side boys.
As the boat casts off the bo's'ns mate pipes again. (Shore boats
and automobiles are not piped.)</p>

<p>You uncover when entering a space where men are at mess
and in Sick Bay (Quarters) if sick men are present. You uncover
in the wardroom at all times if you are junior. All hands
except when under arms uncover in the captain's cabin and
country.</p>

<p>You should not overtake a senior except in emergency. In the
latter case slow, salute, and say, "By your leave, sir."</p>

<p>Admirals and captains when in uniform fly colors astern
when embarked in boats. When on official visits they also display
their personal flags (pennants for commanding officers) in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the bow. Flag officers' barges are distinguished by the appropriate
number of stars on each side of the barge's hull. Captains'
gigs are distinguished by the name or abbreviation of
their ships surcharged by an arrow.</p>

<p>Where gangways are rigged on both sides, the starboard gangway
is reserved for officers and the port for enlisted men. Stress
of weather or expedience (in the discretion of the officer of the
deck or OOD) may make either gangway available to both
officers and men.</p>

<p>Seniors come on board ship first. When reaching the deck you
face toward the colors (or aft if no colors are hoisted) and salute
the colors (quarterdeck). Immediately thereafter you salute the
OOD and request permission to come on board. The usual form
is, "Request permission to come aboard, sir." The OOD is required
to return both salutes.</p>

<p>On leaving the ship the inverse order is observed. You salute
the OOD and request permission to leave the ship. The OOD
will indicate when the boat is ready (if a boat is used). Each
person, juniors first, salutes the OOD; then faces toward the
colors, salutes and embarks.</p>

<p>The OOD on board ship represents the captain and as such
has unquestioned authority. Only the executive and commanding
officer may order him relieved. The authority of the OOD
extends to the accommodation ladders or gangways. He is perfectly
within his rights to order any approaching boat to "lay
off" and keep clear until in his judgment he can receive her
alongside.</p>

<p>The OOD normally conveys orders to the embarked troops via
the Troop Commander but in emergencies he may issue orders
direct to you or any person on board.</p>

<p>The <em>bridge</em> is the "Command Post" of the ship when underway,
as the quarterdeck is at anchor. The officer-of-the-deck is
in charge of the ship as the representative of the captain. Admittance
to the bridge when underway should be at the captain's
invitation or with his permission. You may usually obtain permission
through the executive officer.</p>

<p>The <em>quarterdeck</em> is the seat of authority; as such it is respected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
The starboard side of the quarterdeck is reserved for the captain
(and admiral, if a flagship). No person trespasses upon it except
when necessary in the course of work or official business. All
persons salute the quarterdeck when entering upon it. When
pacing the deck with another officer the place of honor is outboard,
and when reversing direction each turns towards the
other. The port side of the quarterdeck is reserved for commissioned
officers, and the crew has all the rest of the weather
decks of the ship. However, every part of the deck (and the
ship) is assigned to a particular division so that the crew has
ample space. Not unnaturally every division considers it has a
prior though unwritten right to its own part of the ship. For
gatherings such as smokers and movies, all divisions have equal
privileges at the scene of assemblage. Space and chairs are reserved
for officers and for CPO's, where available, and mess
benches are brought up for the men. The seniors have the place
of honor. When the captain (and admiral) arrive those present
are called to attention. The captain customarily gives "carry on"
at once through the executive officer or master-at-arms who accompanies
him to his seat.</p>

<p>If you take passage on board a naval vessel you will be assigned
to one of several messes on board ship, the wardroom
or junior officer's mess. In off-hours, particularly in the evenings,
you can foregather there for cards, yarns or reading. Generally a
percolator is available with hot coffee.</p>

<p>The Executive Officer is ex officio the president of the wardroom
mess. The wardroom officers are the division officers and
the heads of departments. All officers await the arrival of the
Executive Officer before being seated at lunch and dinner. If it
is necessary for you to leave early, ask the head at your table
for permission to be excused as you would at home. The seating
arrangement in the messes is by order of seniority.</p>

<p>Naval Officers are required to pay their mess bills in advance.
The mess treasurer takes care of the receipts and expenditures
and the management of the mess. The mess chooses him by
election every month. When assigned to a mess you are an honorary
member. Consult the mess treasurer as to when he will re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>ceive
payment for mess bills. Your meals are served by stewards
who in addition, clean your room, make up your bunk, shine
your shoes. This is their regular work for which they draw the
pay of their rating. They are not tipped.</p>

<p>The Cigar Mess is the successor of the old Wine Mess. You
may make purchases from this mess, for example, of cigarettes,
cigars, pipe tobacco and candies. The cigar mess treasurer will
make out your bill at the end of the month or before your detachment.
Before you are detached be sure that the mess treasurer
and the cigar mess treasurer have sufficient warning to make
out your bills before you leave. Once a ship has sailed, long
delays usually occur before your remittances can overtake it. The
unpaid mess bill on board is a more serious breach of propriety
than the unpaid club bill ashore because of the greater inconvenience
and delay in settlement.</p>

<p>Passenger officers should call on the captain of the ship. If
there are many, they should choose a calling committee and consult
the executive officer as to a convenient time to call. The
latter will make arrangements with the captain.</p>

<p>Gun salutes in the Navy are the same as in the Army, except
that flag officers below the rank of fleet admiral or general of
the Army are, by Navy regulations, given a gun salute upon
departure only. By Army regulations gun salutes for the same
officers are fired only on arrival.</p>

<p>The rules governing saluting, whether saluting other individuals
or paying honor to the color or National Anthem, are the
same for the Air Force as in the Army, with the minor exceptions
already noted. Because a most frequent contact between the
Air Force and the other services comes of the operations of air
transport, an officer should know what is expected of him when
he travels as a passenger in military aircraft.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the majority of officers visiting an Air
Force base will arrive by air at the local military airfield. In addition
to the Base Operations Officer, who is the commander's
staff officer with jurisdiction over air traffic arriving and departing,
the Airdrome Officer is charged with meeting all transient
aircraft, determining their transportation requirements, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
directing them to the various base facilities. General officers and
admirals will usually be met by the Base Commander if practicable.
RON (Remaining Over Night) messages may be transmitted
through Base Operations at the same time the arrival
notice is filed.</p>

<p>Pilots of transient aircraft carrying classified equipment are
responsible for the safeguarding of that equipment unless it can
be removed from the aircraft and stored in an adequately guarded
area. Under unusual circumstances, it may be possible to
arrange for a special airplane guard with the base commander.</p>

<p>Passengers from other services, who desire to remain overnight
at an air force station should make the necessary arrangements
with the Airdrome Officer, and not attach themselves to the
pilot who will be busy with his own responsibilities. By the
same token, passengers of other services who have had a special
flight arranged for them should make every effort to see that the
pilot and crew are offered the same accommodations that they
themselves are using, unless the particular base has adequate
transient accommodations.</p>

<p>Passenger vehicles are never allowed on the ramp or flight
line unless special arrangements have been made with the Base
Operations Officer; this permission will be granted only under
the most unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>The assigned first pilot, or the airplane commander, is the final
authority on the operation of any military aircraft. Passengers,
regardless of rank, seniority, or service, are subject to the orders
of the airplane commander, who is held responsible for their
adherence to regulations governing conduct in and around the
aircraft. In the event it is impractical for the airplane commander
to leave his position, orders may be transmitted through
the copilot, engineer, or flight clerk, and have the same authority
as if given by the pilot himself.</p>

<p>The order of boarding and alighting from military aircraft&mdash;excluding
the crew&mdash;will vary somewhat with the nature of the
mission. If a special flight is arranged for the transportation of
Very Important Persons, official inspecting parties, or other
high ranking officers of any service, the senior member will enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
first and take the seat of his choice, unless the aircraft is compartmented
otherwise. Other members of the party will enter in
order of rank, and precedence among officers of the same rank
will be determined among the officers themselves. In alighting
from the aircraft, the senior member will exit first, and the other
members of the party will follow either in order of rank, or in
order of seating, those nearest the hatch alighting first. The
duties of the crew preclude their acting as arbiters in matters of
precedence, and order of boarding and alighting will be decided
among the members of the party.</p>

<p>In routine flights, officers will normally be loaded in order of
rank without regard for precedence, except that any VIP will
be on- and off-loaded first; in alighting, officers will leave as they
are seated from the exit forward&mdash;officers seated near the
hatch will debark first, and so on to those who are seated farthest
forward. In the event civilian dependents are being carried, or
an enlisted man accompanied by dependents, they will be loaded
after any VIP and before the officers, and leave in the same
sequence.</p>

<p>Aircraft carrying general or flag officers will usually be marked
with a detachable metal plate carrying stars appropriate to the
highest rank aboard, and will be greeted on arrival by the Air
Force Base Commander, if the destination is an Air Force base.
Other aircraft are usually met by the Airdrome Officer, who is
appointed for one day only, and acts as the Base Commander's
representative.</p>

<p>Other personnel on active duty, seeking transportation on
navigation or training missions, should realize that the flight is at
the pilot's convenience. While the pilot will usually agree to any
reasonable request, he can not deviate from his approved flight
plan simply to accommodate a passenger. By the same token,
passengers should be prompt, observe all pertinent safety regulations,
and remain in the passengers compartment of the aircraft
unless specifically invited to the flight deck or pilot's compartment.
Under instrument conditions&mdash;so-called "blind"
flying&mdash;continuous movement of the passengers of the aircraft
makes unnecessary work for the pilot in maintaining balance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
trim, and his assigned altitude. Passengers who are abnormally
active while in the air are sometimes called&mdash;with exasperation&mdash;"waltzing
mice."</p>

<p>Since flights are somewhat dependent on weather, especially
when carrying passengers, the decision of the pilot to fly or not to
fly, or to alter his flight plan enroute will not be questioned by
the passengers of whatever rank or service. Regulations governing
the use of safety belts; wearing of parachutes; smoking
during take-off, landing, fuel transfer, or in the vicinity of the
aircraft on the ground are binding on all classes of passengers.</p>

<p>When airplanes participate in the funeral of an aviator, it is
customary to fly in a normal tactical formation, less one aircraft,
to indicate the vacancy formerly occupied by the deceased. The
flight should be so timed that it appears over the procession
while the remains are being carried to the grave. Care should be
exercised that the noise of the flight does not drown out the
service at the edge of the grave.</p>

<p>Other ceremonies, including Retreat and reviews, are the
same for the Air Force as for the Army.</p>

<p>By custom; and because it is the natural way of an American,
the officers of the host service accord more than their average
hospitality to the individual from any other service who may be
visiting or doing duty among them. Even the young officer, having
this experience for the first time, and in consequence feeling
a little strange about it, is not permitted to feel that way long.
He quickly finds a second home, provided there is that in his
nature which responds to friendship.</p>

<p>These amenities, carefully observed at all levels, contribute
more directly to a spiritual uniting of American fighting forces
than all of the policies which have been promulgated toward the
serving of that object.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_SEVEN" id="CHAPTER_SEVEN"></a><span class="chapter_number">CHAPTER SEVEN</span><br /><br />

KEEPING YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER</h3>


<p>In one of Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son there is to
be found this bit of wisdom: "Dispatch is the soul of business
and nothing contributes more to dispatch than method. Fix one
certain hour and day in the week for your accounts, keep them
together in their proper order, and you can never be much
cheated."</p>

<p>Although that is good advice in any man's league, there is
just a little more reason why the military officer should adopt
a system of accounting whereby he can keep his record straight,
his affairs solvent and his situation mobile than if he had remained
in civil life.</p>

<p>He rarely, if ever, becomes permanently fixed in one location
or remains tied to one group of individuals who know his credit,
his ability, his past accomplishments and his general reputation.
In the nature of his work, these things have to be reestablished
from point to point, and if he personally does not take pains to
conserve them, he can be certain only that no one else ever will.</p>

<p>On the whole, the attitude of the services toward the private
affairs and nonduty conduct of their officers can be best set
forth by once again employing Chesterfield's phrases: "If you
have the knowledge, the honor, and probity which you may
have, the marks and warmth of my affection will amply reward
you; but if you have them not, my aversion and indignation will
rise in the same proportion."</p>

<p>Reassignment to a distant station is of course a day-to-day
possibility in the life of any military officer. Far from this being a
general hardship, it is because the pattern of work and environment
changes frequently, and the opportunity to build new
friendships is almost endless, that the best men are attracted
to the services. To vegetate in one spot is killing to the spirit of
the individual who is truly fitted to play a lead part in bold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
enterprises, and for that reason there is something very unseemly
and unmilitary about the officer who resists movement.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a move order is like a club over the head
to the officer who hasn't kept his own deck clean, has made no
clear accounting of himself and is out of funds and harassed
by his creditors.</p>

<p>Concerning the evils of running into debt, there is hardly need
for a sermon to any American male who has brains enough to
memorize his general orders. As Mr. Micawber put it to David
Copperfield, "The blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered, the
god of days goes down upon the dreary scene, and&mdash;and in
short, you are forever floored." The over-extension of credit is
a not unknown American failing. It is now the nigh universal
custom to overload the home with every kind of gadget,
usually bought on time, and nearly all intended to provide the
householder with every possible excuse for resisting human toil
or for declining to use any personal ingenuity in making life interesting
for his family. It is all good enough for those who
must have it, but it is well for an officer to remember that the
greater the accumulation, the less his chance of accommodating
his personal establishment to the requirements of the service. All
moves are costly, even though the government pays most of the
freight.</p>

<p>For these and many other reasons, the habit of systematic
saving is an essential form of career insurance. The officer who
will not deprive himself of a few luxuries to build up a financial
reserve is as reckless of his professional future as the one who in
battle commits his manpower reserve to front-line action without
first weighing his situation.</p>

<p>In the old days, keeping up with the Joneses was almost a
part of service tradition. If the colonel's lady owned a bob-tailed
nag, the major's wife could be satisfied with nothing less than a
bay. And so on and on. Things are no longer that way. They
have become much more sensible.</p>

<p>There is one other kind of credit&mdash;the professional credit
which an officer is entitled to keep with his own establishment.
Junior officers are entitled to know that which their superiors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
are often too forgetful to tell them&mdash;that if they have made
some especially distinct and worthy contribution to the service, it
belongs in the permanent record. If, for example, an officer has
written part of a manual, or sat on a major board or committee
or provided the idea which has resulted in an improvement of
materiel, the fact should be noted in the 201 file, or its equivalent.
Such things are not done automatically, as many an
officer has learned too late and to his sorrow. But any officer is
within propriety in asking this acknowledgment from his responsible
superior.</p>

<p>The legal assistance office in an officer's immediate organization
will usually suffice his needs in the drawing of all papers
essential to his personal housekeeping.</p>

<p>To make a will is merely good business practice, and to neglect
it simply because one's holdings are small is to postpone forming
the habits which mark a responsible person. Because of
superstition and a reluctance to think about death, about three
out of every four Americans die intestate. That is about as
foolish as leading men into battle without designating a second
in command. The Armed Services counsel all officers to take the
more responsible view, and make it easy for their officers to do
this duty without cost.</p>

<p>A power of attorney enables one person to take certain legal
steps for another in his absence, and execute papers which would
usually require his signature. When an officer is going on an
extended tour overseas, his interests are apt to be left dangling
unless he leaves such a power with his wife, mother, best friend
or some other person, thereby avoiding loss of money and excess
worry.</p>

<p>Any citizen may draw up a will in his own handwriting, and if
it is properly attested, it will have some standing in court. Likewise,
a power of attorney can be executed on a blank form. But
it is foolish for a military officer to do these things halfway when
the legal offices of the service are available to him, not only for
performing the work, but for counseling him as to its effect.</p>

<p>There is one other step that the responsible man takes on his
own. It is not likely that his wife or any other person knows at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
any one time the whole story of his interests, obligations and
holdings, as to where goods may be stored, savings kept, insurance
policies filed, what debts are owed and what accounts are
receivable. In the event of his sudden death, next of kin would
be at a loss to know whom and where to call to get the estate
settled smoothly, and with all things accurately inventoried. So
it is a practical idea to keep an up-to-date check list in ledger
form, but containing all pertinent information whereby things
may be made readily accessible. If for some private reason, it is
preferred not to leave this with next of kin, it can be kept in a
top drawer at the office, where it could scarcely escape attention.</p>

<p>A current inventory of household goods is also a safety and
time-saving precaution. As changes occur, the list can be corrected
and kept fresh. Then in case of a sudden move, there is
almost nothing to be done in preparation for the movers, and in
the event of loss anywhere along the line, one's own tables will
provide a basis for recovery. Goods are not infrequently mislaid,
lost, or damaged when shipped or warehoused, and the more
authentic the description of the goods in question, the better the
chances for the claim.</p>

<p>For any officer with dependents, insurance is of course a
necessity. How much it should be, and what its form, are matters
for his judgment and conscience, and according to his circumstances.
The services do not try to tell a man how he should
provide for his family. Men of honor need no such reminder,
though they may be bothered by the question: "How much can
I afford?" On that point, sufficient to say that it is <em>not</em> more
blessed to be insolvent and worried about debts from being overloaded
with insurance than for any other reason. Many retired
officers supplement their pay by selling insurance. When a young
service officer wants insurance counsel, he will find that they are
disposed to deal sympathetically with his problem.</p>

<p>A few recurrent expenses, such as insurance premiums and
bond purchases, can be met with allotments through the Finance
or Disbursing Officer. The forms for the starting of an allotment
are quite simple. When an officer is going overseas, if his dependents
are not to follow immediately, an allotment is the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
way to insure that they will get their income regularly. Overseas
expenses are usually quite light, which means that the allotment
may safely be made in larger amount than half the monthly pay.
Under certain circumstances, it may also be arranged for allotments
to be made to banks, as a form of steady saving.</p>

<p>Adverting for a moment to the question of what happens to a
service officer when he becomes ridden by debt and plagued by
his creditors, it is a fair statement that the generality of higher
commanders are not unsympathetic, that they know that shrewdness
and thrift are quite often the product of a broadened experience,
and that their natural disposition is to temper the
wind to the shorn lamb, if there are signs that he is making a
reasonable effort to recover. When it becomes clear that he is
taking the service for a ride and cares nothing for the good
name of the officer corps, they'll send him packing. A man
harassed by debt, and not knowing how to meet his situation, is
always well-advised to go to his commander, make a clean
statement of the case, and ask for his counsel.</p>

<p>Every officer should be absolutely scrupulous about keeping a
complete, chronologically arranged file of all official papers having
anything to do with his status, movements, duties, or possessions.
That may seem burdensome, but it is well worth doing,
since one never knows when an old paper will become germane
to a current question or undertaking.</p>

<p>Likewise, receipts are necessary whenever one spends money
on anything (for instance, travel) on which reimbursement is
expected from the Government. Regulations are clear on this
point&mdash;the Government simply will not give the individual the
benefit of the doubt. No receipt; no check from the Treasury.</p>

<p>The military society is a little more tightly closed than a
civilian society, particularly in posts, camps and stations. For
that reason the pressure from the distaff side is usually a little
heavier. Wives get together more frequently, know one another
better, and take a more direct interest in their husbands' careers
than is common elsewhere. That has its advantages, but also its
headaches. There is an occasional officer who is so immature in
his judgments as to permit his wife's feelings about a colleague<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
or a colleague's wife to supervene in the affairs of organization.
This is one way to ask for trouble.</p>

<p>Gossip is to be avoided because it is vicious, self-destructive,
unmanly, unmilitary and, most of the time, untrue. The obligation
of each officer toward his fellow officer is to build him up,
which implies the use of moral pressure against whatsoever influence
would pull him down. While the love of scandal is universal,
and the services can not hope to rid themselves altogether
of the average human failings, it is possible for any man
to guard his own tongue and, by the example of moderation,
serve to keep all such discussion temperate. Were all officers to
make a conscious striving in this direction, the credit of the corps
as a whole, and the satisfactions of each of its members in his
service, would be tremendously increased. Besides, there is another
point: gossip is the mark of the man insufficiently occupied
with serious thought about his personal responsibilities. His
carelessness about the destruction of the character of others is
incidental to his indifference to those things which make for
character in self.</p>

<p>As for the rest of it, we can turn back to Chesterfield, with
whom we started. For how might any man state it more neatly
than with these words:</p>

<p>"Were I to begin the world again with the experience which I
now have of it, I would lead a life of real, not of imaginary
pleasure. I would enjoy the pleasures of the table and of wine,
but stop short of the pains inseparably annexed to an excess of
either.</p>

<p>"I should let other people do as they would without formally
and sententiously rebuking them for it. But I would be most
firmly resolved not to destroy my own faculties and constitution
in complaisance to those who have no regard for their own.</p>

<p>"I would play to give me pleasure, but not to give me pain.
That is, I would play for trifles in mixed companies, to amuse
myself and conform to custom. But I would take care not to
venture for sums which if I won I would not be the better for,
but if I lost, should be under a difficulty to pay."</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_EIGHT" id="CHAPTER_EIGHT"></a><span class="chapter_number">CHAPTER EIGHT</span><br /><br />

GETTING ALONG WITH PEOPLE</h3>


<p>The main answer can be stated almost as simply as doing
right-face. Hear this:</p>

<p>If you like people, if you seek contact with them rather than
hiding yourself in a corner, if you study your fellow men
sympathetically, if you try consistently to contribute something
to their success and happiness, if you are reasonably generous
with your thoughts and your time, if you have a partial reserve
with everyone but a seeming reserve with no one, if you work to
be interesting rather than spend to be a good fellow, you will
get along with your superiors, your subordinates, your orderly,
your roommate and the human race.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to chart a course for the individual who is
wise enough to make human relationships his main concern. But
getting the knack of it is sufficiently more difficult that it is safe
to say more talk has been devoted to this subject than to any
other topic of conversation since Noah quit the Ark. From
Confucius down to Emily Post, greater and lesser minds have
worked at gentling the human race. By the scores of thousands,
precepts and platitudes have been written for the guidance of
personal conduct. The odd part of it is that despite all of this
labor, most of the frictions in modern society arise from the individual's
feeling of inferiority, his false pride, his vanity, his unwillingness
to yield space to any other man, and his consequent
urge to throw his own weight around. Goethe said that the
quality which best enables a man to renew his own life, in his
relation to others, is that he will become capable of renouncing
particular things at the right moment in order warmly to embrace
something new in the next.</p>

<p>That is earthy advice for any member of the officer corps.
For who is regarded as the strong man in the service&mdash;the individual
who fights with tooth and nail to hold to a particular
post or privilege? Not at all! Full respect is given only to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
who at all times is willing to yield his space to a worthy successor,
because of an ingrained confidence that he can succeed
as greatly in some other sphere.</p>

<p>For a fresh start in this study of getting along with people,
we could not do better than quote what was published some
time ago in the United States Coast Guard Magazine. Under
the title "<em>Thirteen Mistakes</em>," the coast guardsmen raised their
warning flares above the 13 pitfalls. It is a mistake:</p>


<ol>
<li>To attempt to set up your own standard of right and
wrong.</li>

<li>To try to measure the enjoyment of others by your own.</li>

<li>To expect uniformity of opinions in the world.</li>

<li>To fail to make allowance for inexperience.</li>

<li>To endeavor to mold all dispositions alike.</li>

<li>Not to yield on unimportant trifles.</li>

<li>To look for perfection in our own actions.</li>

<li>To worry ourselves and others about what can't be
remedied.</li>

<li>Not to help everybody wherever, however, whenever
we can.</li>

<li>To consider impossible what we cannot ourselves perform.</li>

<li>To believe only what our finite minds can grasp.</li>

<li>Not to make allowances for the weakness of others.</li>

<li>To estimate by some outside quality, when it is that
within which makes the man.</li>
</ol>

<p>The unobserving officer will no doubt dismiss this list as just
so many clich&eacute;s. The reflective man will accept it as a negative
guide to positive conduct, for it engages practically every principle
which is vital to the growth of a strong spiritual life in
relation to one's fellow men.</p>

<p>Certain of these points stand out as prominently as pips on a
radar screen to the military officer bent on keeping his own ship
out of trouble. The morals contained in 4, 5, 12, and 13 all come
to bear in the story told by Sgt. Fred Miller about Pvt. Fred
Lang of Hospital No. 1 on Bataan. Miller had tried to do what
he could for Lang, but no one else in the detachment was willing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
to give him a break. He was an unlettered hillbilly and, being
ashamed of his own ignorance, he was shy toward other men.
The rest of the story is best told in Miller's words.</p>

<p>"When the Japs made their first bombing run on Marivales,
most of us, being new at war, huddled together under such
cover as we could find. Some people were hit outside. We stayed
where we were. But we looked out and saw Lang. He was trying
to handle a stretcher by himself, dragging one end along the
ground in an effort to bring in the wounded. I remember one
member of our group remarking, 'Look at old Lang trying to do
litter drill right in the middle of a war.' Lang was killed by an
enemy bomb that night. I guess he had to die to make us understand
that he was the best man."</p>

<p>There is hardly an American who has been in combat but can
tell some other version of this same story, changing only the
names and the surroundings. All too frequently it happens in the
services&mdash;we look at a man, and because at a casual inspection
we do not like the cut of his jib, or the manner of his response,
or are over-persuaded by what someone else has said about
him, we reach a permanent conclusion about his possibilities, and
either mentally write him off, or impair our own capacity for
giving him help.</p>

<p>It suffices to say that when any officer has the inexcusable
fault that he takes snap judgment on his <em>own</em> men, he will not
be any different in his relations with all other people, and will
stand in his own light for the duration of his career. Which
leads to one other observation. When any man, bearing a bad
efficiency report, comes to a new organization, it is a fact to be
noted with mild interest, but <em>without any prejudice whatever</em>.
Every new assignment means a clean slate, and there should be
no hangover from what has happened, including the possible
mistaken judgments of others. The system was never intended
to give a dog a bad name. To be perpetually supervised, questioned
and shadowed is to be doubted, and doubt destroys confidence
and creates fear, slyness and discontent in the other individual.
Every man is entitled to a fresh hold on security with his
new superior. Any wise and experienced senior commander will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
tell you this, and will cite examples of men who came to him
with a spotty record, who started nervously, began to pick up
after realizing that they were not going to get another kick, and
went on to become altogether superior. For any right-minded
commander, it is far more gratifying to be able to salvage human
material than to take over an organization that is sound from
bottom to top.</p>

<p>However, the truth in point 9 applies universally. The studied
effort to be helpful in all of our relations with our fellow men,
and to give help not grudgingly, but cheerfully, courteously and
in greater measure than is expected, is the high road to wide
influence and personal strength of character. More than all else,
it is the little kindnesses in life which bind men together and
help each wayfarer to start the day right. These tokens are like
bread cast upon the water; they ultimately nourish the giver
more than the direct beneficiary. One of our best-known corps
commanders in the Pacific War made it a rule that if any man
serving under him, or any man he knew in the service, however
unimportant, was promoted or given any other recognition, he
would write a letter to the man's wife or mother, saying how
proud he felt. He was not a great tactician or strategist but,
because of the little things he did, men loved him and would ride
to hell for him, and their collective moral strength became the
bastion of his professional success.</p>

<p>Of Maj. Gen. Henry T. Allen, who commanded our first Army
of Occupation in Germany, a distinguished contemporary once
said: "It surprised us that Allen did so well; in the old Army
we regarded him as a swashbuckler." Maybe that was because he
was a cavalryman and liked to strut, and he liked to see chestiness
in his own people, right down to the last file. But General
Allen was infinitely considerate of the dignity of all other men,
and he disciplined himself to further their growth and give
them some mark of his thoughtful regard so far as lay within
his power. It was because of his rich understanding humanity,
and not through any genial slackness, that he kept a tight hold
on discipline. To the units he commanded he gave his own tone.
He warmed men instead of chilling them with fear. Thousands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
returned to civil life better equipped for the passage because of
what they had seen him do and heard him say.</p>

<p>So we can link points 1, 6, 7, and 8 from the Coast Guard's
list into one binding truth not less essential to sound officership
than to action anywhere which seeks the cooperation and goodwill
of men: <em>It is not more blessed to be right than to be loved</em>,
Henry Clay's remark that he would rather be right than president
notwithstanding. The absolute perfectionist is the most
tiresome of men, and a waster of time and of nerves. The
stickler, the fly-speckler, the bully and the sadist serve only to
encumber those parts of the establishment which they touch;
their subordinates spend part of their own strength clearing
away the wreckage which these misfits make.</p>

<p>Other than these comments, it is not necessary to say a great
deal about the <em>inner qualities</em> which give an officer a free-wheeling
adjustment with other persons in all walks of life. Once
again, however, it might be well to speak of the importance of
enthusiasm, kindness, courtesy, and justice, which are the safeguards
of honor and the tokens of mutual respect between man
and man. This last there must be if men are to go forward together,
prosper in one another's company, find strength in the
bonds of mutual service, and experience a common felicity in
the relationship between the leader and the led.</p>

<p>But it is sadly the case that the reputation of any man, as to
what he is inside, forms in large measure from what others see
of him from the outside. That is what makes poignant the story
of Pvt. Fred Lang; like a singed cat, he was better than he
looked. In the military service, more than elsewhere in life,
manner weighs heavily in the balance, if only for the reason
that from the public point of view, the military officer is supposed
to look the part. He is expected to be the embodiment of
character, given to forthright but amiable speech, capable of
expressing his ideas and purpose clearly, careful of customs and
good usage, and carrying himself with poise and assurance. For
if he does not have the aura of vitality, confidence and reflection
which is expected in a leader of men, it will be suspected that
he is incapable of playing the part. However unfairly discrimi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>nating
that judgment may seem to be, in comparison with the
attitude toward other professions, it has a perfectly logical basis.
The people are willing to forgive preoccupation in all others,
since how an engineer dresses has no relation to his skill as a
mathematician, and when a doctor mumbles it doesn't suggest
that he would be clumsy with a scalpel. But when they meet an
uncivil or unkempt officer, or see an untidy soldier or bluejacket
on the street, they worry that the national defense is going to
pot. One reason for the great prestige of the Marine Corps is
that the public seldom, if ever, sees a sloppy marine, though its
members do sometimes look a little gruesome on the field of
battle.</p>

<p>The officer corps does have its share of "characters." Some
are men born in an uncommon mold, with a great deal of
natural phlegm in their systems, a gift for salty speech and a
tendency to drawl their words as if their thoughts were being
raised from a deep well. Usually, they are men of extraordinary
power, and are worth any dozen of that individual who scuttles
about like a water bug, making an exhibition of great energy
but, like the whirling dervish, keeping in such constant motion
that he has no chance to observe what goes on under his nose.
Here, as in all things, it is steadiness that does it. The blunt
soldier, the old sea-dog type of naval officer, is endurable and
even lovable in the eyes of most other people, when he has done
his scrapping with fire rather than firewater, when his personal
credentials are sound, and when his outward manner is bluff in
both meanings of the word. But the fakers who affect the crusty
manner, the glaring eye and the jutting jaw, simply because
they are wearing military suits and think mistakenly that these
things are in the tradition, will be recognized as counterfeit as
quickly as a lead quarter.</p>

<p>There is nothing else that serves as well as the natural manner,
with some polishing of the surfaces here and there, and a
general tightening at the corners.</p>

<p>While a partial check list is not likely to reform the establishment
overnight, if kept simple enough, it may afford help to an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
occasional individual, instead of giving him the fear that he is
falling apart at the seams.</p>

<p>The smartest physical culturists are swinging around to the
idea that correct posture alone is the great secret of physical
fitness, that if a man sits well, stands erect and walks correctly
all the time, he is doing more for his health and longevity than
all of the setting-up exercises and sweat baths yet devised. At the
same time he is making a favorable impression on all who see
him. Clumsy one-sided postures, fidgeting on a chair, slouching
while sitting or standing, moving along at a shambling gait and
speaking with the chin down on the chest produce quite the
opposite effect. Right or wrong, they are taken as a sign of indolence,
fatigue, or inattention. There is always an hour for
complete physical relaxation, for stretching and letting the muscles
melt; Winston Churchill attributed a large part of his vigor
and recuperative powers to the habit of taking a 30-minute cat
nap in midday. That is a smart trick if one can master it. But
trying most of all for <em>physical ease</em> when in conversation, or at
conference, or in attending to any matter wherein one comes
under the surveillance of those whose good opinion is worth
cultivating is as certain a handicap as putting excess weight on
an otherwise good horse.</p>

<p>In the services, as in any situation in life in which deference
to higher opinion is compelled by the nature of an undertaking,
the young will do well to consider the wisdom of the precept,
"Be patient with your betters."</p>

<p>It is lamentably bad judgment to act by any other rules.
Where differences of opinion exist, time and forbearance not infrequently
will work the desired change, where stubbornness or
rudeness would utterly fail. More than that, a junior owes this
much consideration to any senior whose heart is in the right
place. It is bad manners, but even worse from the standpoint of
tactics, to attempt publicly to score a victory over a senior in
any dispute, or to attempt by wit to gain the upperhand of him
in the presence of others. Though the point may be gained for
the moment, it is usually at the cost of one's personal hold on the
confidence of the senior.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>But there is also the other side of the case, that the superior
should deal considerately with any earnest proposal from his
subordinate, rather than dashing cold water in his face, just because
he has not thought his proposition through. One of the
best-loved editors of the United States, Grove Patterson, of
Toledo, Ohio, was remembered by every young journalist who
ever came under him because of the care with which he supported
every man's pride. A youngster would go in to him, filled
with enthusiasm for some idea, which he himself had not bothered
to view in the round. Patterson would listen carefully, and
would then say: "That's a corking idea. Take it and work it out
carefully, going over every aspect of it. Then bring it back to
me." On second thought, the youngster would begin having his
own doubts, and would shortly begin hoping that the chief
would forget all about the subject, which he invariably did.
Many celebrated commanders in our military services have won
the lasting affection of their subordinates by employing exactly
this method.</p>

<p>Men like the direct glance. They feel flattered by it, particularly
when they are talking, and in conversation they like to be
heard through, not interrupted in mid-passage. That is true
whatever their station. Nobody likes to be bored, but fully half
of boredom comes from lack of the habit of careful listening.
The man who will not listen never develops wits enough to distinguish
between a bore and a sage and therefore cannot pick
the best company. The vacant stare, the drifting of eyes from the
speaker to a window, or a picture or a passing blonde, though
greatly tempting in the midst of long discourse, are taken only
as signs of inattention. Many a young officer called to the carpet
for some trivial business has managed to square himself with his
commander just by looking straight and talking straight in the
few moments that decided his future.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the book, a great deal has been said about the
importance of the voice and of developing one's powers of conversation.
Not a great deal more needs to be added here. But
there is no excuse for the officer who talks so that others must
strain to hear what he is saying&mdash;unless he is suffering from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
laryngitis. It is simple enough to keep the chin up and let the
words roll out. Many persons have the bad habit of letting the
voice drop at the end of a sentence; the effect on the other
party is like watching a man run away from a fight. For clear
understanding, and to create a good impression, there should be
a cheerful lift upward at the end of a sentence.</p>

<p>Also, officers who look at lecturing simply as part of the routine
tend to fall into either the singsong rhythm which one frequently
hears in college professors and certain radio announcers,
or go all out for the sonorous intonations which are beloved by
many of the clergy. Many young officers get into these same
cadences whenever they talk to men, and before they know it,
they are trying the same thing in the family circle. They sound
like alarm clocks running down, but instead of arousing the
house, they are an invitation to slumber. Either on the lecture
platform, or in man-to-man conversation, there is no valid reason
why it is ever necessary to take the tone which suggests that
the talk is one-sided. Words can be crisply uttered and still be
personally directed, but not if the speaker is looking at the floor,
the moon or the rafters. To discuss a question amicably is the
best way to gain clear insight into it; when a man argues violently,
his purpose usually is not to serve wisdom but to prevail
despite his lack of it, thus stultifying both himself and his adversary.</p>

<p>Clothes are important. They have to be. One can't go very
far without them, north of the Equator. But a fresh press counts
more than a new suit by a Fifth Avenue tailor left unpressed,
and neatness beats lavishness any day in the week.</p>

<p>Carefulness in the little things counts much. Men develop an
aversion to the individual who cannot remember their names,
their titles or their stations, but they will warm to the person who
remembers, and they will overlook most of his other shortcomings.
Likewise, they are won by any words of appreciation or
of interest in what they are doing. Get a man talking about his
business, his golf game or his family, and you are on the inside
track toward his friendship. As for senior commanders, when the
hours comes for them to bat the ball back and forth in friendly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
conversation, there is nothing they enjoy more than reminiscing
about experiences on the battlefield. Other than inveterate surgical
patients, no one can outdo them in talking about their
operations.</p>

<p>It isn't lengthy advice which is needed on this subject, since
a man commissioned is considered to have graduated from at
least the kindergarten of good manners. What counts is simply
caring about it, not to be ingratiating to other people, but for
the sake of one's own dignity and self-respect.</p>

<p>None of the oracles on winning friends and influencing people
have said it in those few words, and if they had, there would
have been no books to sell.</p>

LEADERS AND LEADERSHIP</h3>


<p>In that gallery of Great Americans whose names are conspicuously
identified with the prospering of the national arms in
peace and war, there are almost as many types as there are men.</p>

<p>There were a certain few qualities that they had to possess in
common or their names would never have become known beyond
the county line.</p>

<p>But these were inner qualities, often deep buried, rather than
outward marks of greatness which men recognized immediately
upon beholding them.</p>

<p>Some almost missed the roll call, either because in early life
their weaknesses were more apparent than their strengths, or because
of an outward seeming of insignificance which at first
fooled their contemporaries.</p>

<p>In the minority are the few who seemed marked for greatness
almost from the cradle, and were acclaimed for leadership while
still of tender years.</p>

<p>Winfield Scott, a Brigadier in the War of 1812 when Brigadiers
were few, and Chief of Staff when the Civil War began, is
a unique figure in the national history.</p>

<p>George Washington, Adjutant of the State of Virginia at 21, is
one other military infant prodigy who never later belied his early
fame.</p>

<p>The majority in the gallery are not like these. No two of them
are strikingly alike in mien and manner. Their personalities are
as different, for most part, as their names. Their characters also
ran the range of the spectrum, or nearly, if we are talking of
moral habit, rather than of conscientious performance of military
duty. Some drank their whiskey neat and frequently; others
loathed it and took a harsh line with any subordinate who used
it.</p>

<p>One of the greatest generals in American history, celebrated
for his fighting hardly more than for his tippling, would walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
from the room if any man tried to tell an off-color story in his
presence.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated and successful of our Admirals
endeared himself to millions of men in all ranks and services by
his trick of gathering his chief subordinates together just prior
to battle, issuing his orders sternly and surely, and then relaxing
long enough to tell them his latest parlor story, knowing that
finally it would trickle down through the whole command.</p>

<p>Among the warriors in this gallery are men who would bet a
month's pay on a horse race. There are duellists and brawlers,
athletes and aesthetes, men who lived almost sainted lives and
scholars who lived more for learning than for fame.</p>

<p>Some tended to be so over-reclusive that they almost missed
recognition; others were hail-fellow-well-met in any company.</p>

<p>Their methods of work reflected these extreme variations in
personal type, as did the means they used to draw other men to
them, thereby setting a foundation for real success.</p>

<p>Part of their number commanded mainly through the sheer
force of ideas; others owed their fortune more to the magnetism
of dynamic personality.</p>

<p>In a few there was the spark of genius. All things seemed to
come right with them at all times. Fate was kind, the openings
occurred, and they were prepared to take advantage of them.</p>

<p>But the greater number moved up the hill one slow step at a
time, not always sure of their footing, buffeted by mischance,
owning no exalted opinion of their own merits, reacting to discouragement
much as other men would do, but finally accumulating
power as they learned how to organize the work of other
men.</p>

<p>While a young lieutenant, Admiral Sims became so incensed,
when the United States would not take his word on a voucher,
that he offered to resign.</p>

<p>General Grant signally failed to organize his life as an individual
prior to the time when a turn of the wheel gave him his
chance to organize the military power of the United States in
war.</p>

<p>General Sherman, who commanded the Army for almost 15<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
years, was considered by many of his close friends to be a fit
subject for confinement as a mental case just prior to the Civil
War.</p>

<p>General Meade, one of the sweetest and most serene of men in
his family relationships, lacked confidence in his own merits and
was very abusive of his associates during battle.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut, whose tenderness as an individual are
marked by the 16 years in which he personally nursed an invalid
wife, was so independent in his professional thought and
action that both in and out of the Navy he was disqualified as a
"climber." He got into wretched quarrels with his superiors
mainly because he felt his assignments afforded him no distinction.
The Civil War gave him his opportunity.</p>

<p>Admiral John Paul Jones, though an unusually modest man,
was as redoubtable in the boudoir as at sea, and it would be hard
to say which type of engagement most caught his fancy.</p>

<p>General Winfield Scott, as firm a commander as ever drew on
a glove, plagued the service with his petty bickering over rank,
seniority, and precedent.</p>

<p>They were all mortal. Being human, they had their points of
personal weakness, just as any newly appointed ensign or second
lieutenant also has weak spots in his armor, and sometimes
views them in such false proportion that he doubts his own
potential for high responsibility.</p>

<p>There is not one perfect life in the gallery of the great. All
were moulded by the human influences which surrounded them.
They reacted in their own feelings, and toward other men, according
as their personal fortunes rose and fell. They sought help
where it could be found. When disappointed, they chilled like
anyone else. But along with their professional talents, they
possessed, in common, a desire for substantial recognition, accompanied
by the will to earn it fairly, or else the nation would
never have heard their names.</p>

<p>All in all it is a multifarious gallery. If we were to pass it in
review, and then inspect it carefully, it would still be impossible
to say: "This is the composite of character. This is the proto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>type
of military success. Model upon it and you have the pinnacle
within reach."</p>

<p>The same thing would no doubt hold true of a majority of the
better men who commanded ships, squadrons, regiments, and
companies under these commanders, and at their own level were
as superior in leadership as the relatively few who rose to
national stature because of the achievements of the general body.</p>

<p>The same rule will apply tomorrow. Those who come forward
to fill these same places, and to command them with equal or
greater authority and competence, will not be plaster saints,
laden with all human virtue, spotless in character and fit to be
anointed with a superman legend by some future Parson Weems.
They will be men with a human quality, and a strong belief in
the United States and the goodness of a free society. They will
have some of the average man's faults, and maybe a few of his
vices. But certainly they will possess the qualities of courage,
creative intelligence and physical fitness in more than average
measure.</p>

<p>What we know of our great leaders in the current age should
disparage the idea that only a superman may scale the heights.
Trained observers have noted in their personalities and careers
many of the plain characteristics which each man feels in himself
and mistakenly believes is a bar to preferment.</p>

<p>Drew Middleton, the British correspondent, wrote of Gen.
Carl "Tooey" Spaatz: "This man, who may be a heroic figure
to our grandchildren, is essentially an unheroic figure to his contemporaries.
He is in fact such a friendly, human person that
observers tend to minimize his stature as a war leader. He is not
temperamental. He makes no rousing speeches, writes no inspirational
orders. Spaatz, in issuing orders for a major operation
involving 1,500 airplanes, is about as inspiring as a groceryman
ordering another five cases of canned peas."</p>

<p>In the files of the Navy Department there is a picture of
Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, the famed commander of Task
Force 58, coming on board a flagship to take command of a
force of carriers. Officers and men are lined up at spick-and-span
attention. The Admiral himself appears as a little man in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
a rumpled khaki uniform, tieless and wearing an informal garrison
cap. Under his arm is a book, and in the photograph the
title can be read as "Send Another Coffin." Mitscher liked detective
stories; he didn't like ceremonial pomp.</p>

<p>An interviewer who called on Gen. Ira C. Eaker when he was
leading 8th Air Force against Germany found "a strikingly soft-spoken,
sober, compact man who has the mild manner of a conservative
minister and the judicial outlook of a member of the
Supreme Court. But he is always about two steps ahead of
everybody on the score, and there is a quiet, inexorable logic
about everything he does." Of his own choice, Eaker would have
separated from military service after World War I. He wanted to
be a lawyer and he also toyed with the idea of running a country
newspaper. In his off hours, he wrote books on aviation for
junior readers. On the side, he studied civil law and found it
"valuable mental training."</p>

<p>On the eve of the Guadalcanal landing, Gen. A. A. Vandegrift's
final order to his command ended with the stirring and
now celebrated phrase: "God favors the bold and strong of
heart." Yet in the afterglow of later years, the Nation read a
character sketch of him which included this: "He is so polite
and so soft spoken that he is continually disappointing the people
whom he meets. They find him lacking in the fire-eating
traits they like to expect of all marines, and they find it difficult
to believe that such a mild-mannered man could really have led
and won the bloody fight." When another officer spoke warmly
of Vandegrift's coolness under fire, his "grace under pressure,"
to quote Hemingway's phrase, he replied: "I shouldn't be given
any credit. I'm built that way."</p>

<p>The point is beautifully taken. Too often the man with great
inner strength holds in contempt those less well endowed by
nature than himself.</p>

<p>While there are no perfect men, there are those who become
relatively perfect leaders of men because something in their
makeup brings out in strength the highest virtues of all who
follow them. That is the way of human nature. Minor shortcomings
do not impair the working loyalty, or growth, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
follower who has found someone whose strengths he deems
worth emulating. On the other hand, to recognize merit, you
must yourself have it. <em>The act of recognizing the worthwhile
traits in another person is both the test and the making of
character.</em> The man who scorns all others, and thinks no one else
worth following, parades his own inferiority before the world.
He puts his own character into bankruptcy just as surely as does
that other sad camp follower of whom Thomas Carlyle wrote:
"To recognize false merit, and crown it as true, because a long
tail runs after it, is the saddest operation under the sun."</p>

<p>Sherman, Logan, Rawlins and the many others hitched their
wagons to Grant's star because they saw in him a man who had
a way with other men, and who commanded them not less by
personal courage than by patient work in their interest. Had
Grant spent time brooding over his civilian failures, he would
have been stuck with a disorderly camp and would never have
gotten out of Illinois.</p>

<p>The nobility of the private life and influence of Gen. Robert
E. Lee and the grandeur of his military character are known to
every American school boy. His peerless gifts as a battle leader
have won the tribute of celebrated soldiers and historians
throughout the English-speaking world. Likewise, the deep religiosity
of his great lieutenant, Stonewall Jackson, the latter's
fiery zeal and the almost evangelical power with which he lifted
the hearts of all men who followed him, are hallmarks of character
that are vividly remembered in whatever context his name
happens to be mentioned.</p>

<p>If we turn for a somewhat closer look at Grant it is because he,
more than any other American soldier, left us a full, clear
narrative of his own growth, and of the inner thoughts and
doubts pertaining to himself which attended his life experience.
There was a great deal of the average man in Grant. He was
beset by human failings. He could not look impressive. He had
no sense of destiny. In his great hours, it was sweat, rather than
inspiration, dogged perseverance, rather than the aura of power,
which made the hour great.</p>

<p>Average though he was in many things, there was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
average about the strong way in which he took hold, applying
massive common sense to the complex problems of the field.
That is why he is worth close regard. His virtues as a military
leader were of the simpler sort which plain men may understand
and hope to emulate. He was direct in manner. He never
intrigued. His speech was homely. He was approachable. His
mind never deviated from the object. Though a stubborn man,
he was always willing to listen to his subordinates. He never
adhered to a plan obstinately, but nothing could induce him to
forsake the idea behind the plan.</p>

<p>History has left us a clear view of how he attained to greatness
in leadership by holding steadfastly to a few main principles.</p>

<p>At Belmont, his first small action, he showed nothing to indicate
that he was competent as a tactician and strategist. But the
closing scene reveals him as the last man to leave the field of
action, risking his life to see that none of his men had been left
behind.</p>

<p>At Fort Donelson, where he had initiated an amphibious
campaign of highly original daring, he was not on the battlefield
when his army was suddenly attacked. He arrived to find
his right wing crushed and his whole force on the verge of defeat.
He blamed no one. Without more than a passing second's
hesitation, he said quietly to his chief subordinates: "Gentlemen,
the position on the right must be retaken." Then he
mounted his horse, and galloped along the line shouting to his
men: "Fill your cartridge cases quick; the enemy is trying to
escape and he must not be permitted to do so." Control and
order were immediately reestablished by his presence.</p>

<p>At Shiloh, the same thing happened, only this time it was
worse; the whole Union Army was on the verge of rout. Grant,
hobbling on crutches from a recent leg injury, met the mob of
panic-stricken stragglers as he left the boat at Pittsburgh Landing.
Calling on them to turn back, he mounted and rode toward
the battle, shouting encouragement and giving orders to all he
met. Confidence flowed from him back into an already beaten
Army and in this way a field near lost was soon regained.</p>

<p>The last and best picture of Grant is on the evening after he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
had taken his first beating from General Lee in the campaign
against Richmond. He was newly with the Army of the Potomac.
His predecessors, after being whipped by Lee, had invariably retreated
to safe distance. But this time as the defeated army took
the road of retreat out of the Wilderness, its columns got only as
far as the Chancellorsville House crossroad. There the soldiers
saw a squat, bearded man, sitting horseback, and drawing on a
cigar. As the head of each regiment came abreast him, he silently
motioned it to take the right-hand fork&mdash;back toward Lee's
flank and deeper than ever into the Wilderness. That night for
the first time the Army sensed an electric change in the air over
Virginia. It had a man.</p>

<p>"I intend to fight it out on this line" is more revealing of the
one supreme quality which put the seal on all other of U. S.
Grant's great gifts for military leading than everything else that
the historians have written of him. He was the epitome of that
spirit which moderns call "seeing the show through." He was
sensitive to a fault in his early years, and carried to his tomb a
dislike for military uniform, caused by his being made the butt of
ridicule the first time he ever donned a soldier suit. As a junior
lieutenant in the Mexican War, he sensed no particular aptitude
in himself. But he had participated in every engagement possible
to a member of his regiment, and had executed every small duty
to the hilt, with particular attention to conserving the lives of
his men. This was the school and the course which later enabled
him to march to Richmond, when men's lives had to be
spent for the good of the Nation. In more recent times, one of the
great statesmen and soldiers of the United States, Henry L.
Stimson, has added his witness to the value of this force in all
enterprise: "I know the withering effect of limited commitments
and I know the regenerative effect of full action." Though he
was speaking particularly of the larger affairs of war and nation
policy, his words apply with full weight to the personal life.
The truth seen only halfway is missed wholly; the thing done
only halfway had best not be attempted at all. Men can be
fooled but they can't be fooled on this score. They will know
every time when the bolt falls short for lack of a worthwhile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
effort. And when that happens, confidence in the leader is corroded,
even among those who themselves were unwilling to try.</p>

<p>There have been great and distinguished leaders in our military
services at all levels, who had no particular gifts for administration,
and little for organizing the detail of decisive action
either within battle or without. They excelled because of a
superior ability to utilize the brains and command the loyalty
of well-chosen subordinates. Their particular function was to
judge the mark according to their resources and audacity, and
then to hold the team steady until the mark was gained. So
doing, they complemented the power of the faithful lieutenants
who might have put them in the shade in any I. Q. test. Wrote
Grant: "I never knew what to do with a paper except put it in
a side pocket or pass it to a clerk who understood it better than I
did." There was nothing unfair or irregular about this; it was as
it should be. All military achievement develops out of unity of
action. The laurel goes to the man whose powers can most surely
be directed toward the end purposes of organization. <em>The winning
of battles is the product of the winning of men.</em> That aptitude
is not an endowment of formal education, though the man
who has led a football team, a class, a fraternity or a debating
society is the stronger for the experience which he has gained.
It is not uncustomary in those who have excelled in scholarship
to despise those who have excelled merely in sympathetic understanding
of the human race. But in the military services, though
there are niches for the pedant, character is at all times at least
as vital as intellect, and the main rewards go to him who can
make other men feel toughened as well as elevated.</p>


<ul>
<li><em>Quiet resolution.</em></li>

<li><em>The hardihood to take risks.</em></li>

<li><em>The will to take full responsibility for decision.</em></li>

<li><em>The readiness to share its rewards with subordinates.</em></li>

<li><em>An equal readiness to take the blame when things go adversely.</em></li>

<li><em>The nerve to survive storm and disappointment and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
face toward each new day with the scoresheet wiped
clean, neither dwelling on one's successes nor accepting
discouragement from one's failures.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In these things lie a great part of the essence of leadership, for
they are the constituents of that kind of moral courage which
has enabled one man to draw many others to him in any age.</p>

<p>It is good, also, to look the part, not only because of its effect
on others, but because from out of the effort made to <em>look it</em>,
one may in time come <em>to be it</em>. One of the kindliest and most
penetrating philosophers of our age, Abb&eacute; Ernest Dimnet, has
assured us that this is true. He says that by trying to look and
act like a socially distinguished person, one may in fact attain
to the inner disposition of a gentleman. That, almost needless
to say, is the <em>real</em> mark of the officer who takes great pains about
the manner of his dress and address, for as Walt Whitman has
said: "All changes of appearances without a change in that
which underlies appearance, are without avail." All depends
upon the spirit in which one makes the effort. By his own account,
U. S. Grant, as a West Point cadet, was more stirred by
the commanding appearance of General Winfield Scott than by
any man he had ever seen, including the President. He wrote
that at that moment there flashed across his mind the thought
that some day he would stand in Scott's place. Grant was unkempt
of dress. His physical endowments were such that he
could never achieve the commanding air of Scott, but he left us
his witness that Scott's military bearing helped kindle his own
desire for command, even though he knew that he could not be
like Scott.</p>

<p>Much is said in favor of modesty as an asset in leadership. It
is remarked that the man who wishes to hold the respect of
others will mention himself not more frequently than a born
aristocrat mentions his ancestor. However, the point can be
labored too hard. Some of the ablest of the Nation's battlefield
commanders have been anything but shrinking violets; we have
had now and then a hero who could boast with such gusto that
this very characteristic somehow endeared him to his men. But
that would be a dangerous tack for all save the most exceptional
individual. Instead of speaking of modesty as a charm that will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
win all hearts, thereby risking that through excessive modesty a
man will become tiresome to others and rated as too timid for
high responsibility, it would be better to dwell upon the importance
of being natural, which means neither concealing nor
making a vulgar display of one's ideals and motives, but acting
directly according to their dictations.</p>

<p>This leads to another point. In several of the most celebrated
commentaries written by higher commanders on the nature of
generalship, the statement is made rather carelessly that to be
capable of great military leadership a man must be something of
an actor. If that were unqualifiedly true, then it would be a
desirable technique likewise in any junior officer that he too
should learn how to wear a false face, and play a part which
cloaks his real self. The hollowness of the idea is proved by the
lives of such men as Robert E. Lee, W. T. Sherman, George C.
Marshall, Omar N. Bradley, Carl A. Spaatz, William H. Simpson,
Chester A. Nimitz, and W. S. Sims. As commanders, they
were all as natural as children, though some had great natural
reserve, and others were warmer and more outgiving. They expressed
themselves straightforwardly rather than by artful striving
for effect. There was no studied attempt to appear only in a
certain light. To use the common word for it, their people did
not regard them as "characters." This naturalness had much to
do with their hold on other men.</p>

<p>Such a result will always come. He who concentrates on the
object at hand has little need to worry about the impression he
is making on others. Even though they detect the chinks in the
armor, they will know that the armor will hold.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a sense of the dramatic values, coupled
with the intelligence to play upon them skillfully, is an invaluable
quality in any military leader. Though there was nothing of
the "actor" in Grant, he understood the value of pointing things
up. <em>To put a bold or inspiring emphasis where it belongs is not
stagecraft, but an integral part of the military fine art of communications.</em>
System which is only system is injurious to the
mind and spirit of any normal person. One can play a superior
part well, and maintain prestige and dignity, without being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
under the compulsion to think, speak and act in a monotone. In
fact, when any military commander becomes over-inhibited
along these lines because of the illusion that this is the way to
build a reputation for strength, he but doubles the necessity that
his subordinates will act at all times like human beings rather
than robots.</p>

<p>Coupled with self-control, recollection and thoughtfulness
will carry a man far. Men will warm toward a leader when they
come to believe that all the energy he stores up by living somewhat
within himself is at their service. But when they feel that
this is not the case, and that his reserve is simply the outward
sign of a spiritual miserliness and concentration on purely personal
goals, no amount of restraint will ever win their favor.
This is as true of him who commands a whole service as of the
leader of a picket squad.</p>

<p>To speak of the importance of a sense of humor would be
unavailing if it were not that what cramps so many men isn't
that they are by nature humorless but that they are hesitant to
exercise what humor they possess. Within the military profession,
it is as unwise as to let the muscles go soft and to spare the
mind the strain of original thinking. Great humor has always
been in the military tradition. The need of it is nowhere more
delicately expressed than in Kipling's lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My son was killed while laughing at some jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">I would I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What it was, and it might serve me in a time<br /></span>
<span class="i10">When jests are few.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Marcus Aurelius, Rome's soldier philosopher, spoke of his love
for the man who "could be humorous in an agreeable way." No
reader of Grant's <em>Memoirs</em> (one of the few truly great autobiographies
ever written by a soldier) could fail to be impressed
by his light touch. A delicate sense of the incongruous seems to
have pervaded him; he is at his whimsical best when he sees
himself in a ridiculous light. Lord Kitchener, one of the grimmest
warriors ever to serve the British Empire, warmed to the
man who made him the butt of a practical joke. There is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
unforgettable picture of Admiral Beatty at Jutland. The <em>Indefatigable</em>
has disappeared beneath the waves. The <em>Queen Mary</em>
had exploded. The <em>Lion</em> was in flames. Then word came that
the <em>Princess Royal</em> was blown up. Said Beatty to his Flag Captain
"Chatfield, there seems to be something wrong with our ... ships
today. Turn two points nearer the enemy." Admiral
Nimitz, surveying the terrible landscape of the Kwajalein battlefield
for the first time, said gravely to his Staff: "It's the worst
devastation I've ever seen except for that last Texas picnic in
Honolulu." There is a characteristic anecdote of General Patton.
He had just been worsted by higher headquarters in an argument
over strategy. So he sat talking to his own Staff about it,
his dog curled up beside him. Suddenly he said to the animal:
"The trouble with you, too, Willy, is that you don't understand
the big picture." General Eisenhower, probably more than any
other American commander, had the art of winning with his
humor. He would have qualified under Sydney Smith's definition:
"The meaning of an extraordinary man is that he is eight
men in one man; that he has as much wit as if he had no sense,
and as much sense as if he had no wit; that his conduct is as
judicious as if he were the dullest of human beings, and his
imagination as brilliant as if he were irretrievably ruined."</p>

<p>There is hardly a soldier, marine, or bluejacket who has been
long in battle but can tell some tale of an experience under fire
when the pressure became almost unbearable, and then was
suddenly relieved because somebody made a wisecrack or pulled
something that was good for a laugh. At Bastogne the American
headquarters was being shelled out of its position in the
Belgian Barracks. The Commanding General called in his Chief
Signal Officer and asked when it would be convenient to move.
Said Lt. Col. Sid Davis, "Right now, while I've got one line
left and you can still give the order." When the garrison was surrounded,
and higher headquarters requested a description of the
situation, the young G-3 of the operation, Col. H. W. O. Kinnard,
radioed: "Think of a doughnut: we're the hole."</p>

<p>Who hasn't heard of the top kick who got his men forward by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>yelling: "Come on you &mdash;&mdash;! Do you want to live forever?"
Both the Army and the Marine Corps claim him for their own,
and it is possible that he was twins.</p>

<p>If the American fighting man did not have an instinctive feeling
for the moral value of that kind of thing, the story would be
long since buried, for it is as ancient as the other tale which
ends: "That was no lady; that was my wife."</p>

MAINSPRINGS OF LEADERSHIP</h3>


<p>To what has been said, just a few things should be added so
that the problem of generating greater powers of leadership
within the officer corps may be seen in its true light.</p>

<p>The counselor says: "Be forthright! Be articulate! Be confident!
Be positive! Possess a commanding appearance!" The
young man replies: "All very good, so far as it goes. I will, if I
can. But tell me, how do I get that way?" He sees rightly
enough the main point, that these things are but derivatives of
other inner qualities which must be possessed, if the leader is to
travel the decisive mile between wavering capacity and resolute
performance.</p>

<p>So the need is to get down to a few governing principles.
Finding them, we may be able to resolve finally any argument
as to whether leadership is a God-given power, or may be bestowed
through earnest military teaching.</p>

<p>Two great American commanders have spoken their thoughts
on this subject. The weight of their comment is enhanced by
the conspicuous success of both men in the field of moral
leading.</p>

<p>Said Admiral Forrest P. Sherman, Chief of Naval Operations:
"I concur that we <em>can</em> take average good men and, by
proper training, develop in them the essential initiative, confidence,
and magnetism which are necessary in leadership. I believe
that these qualities are present in the average man to a
degree that he can be made a good leader if his native qualities
are properly developed; whether or not he becomes a <em>great</em>
leader depends upon whether or not he possesses that <em>extra</em> initiative,
magnetism, moral courage, and force which makes the
difference between the average man and the above-average
man."</p>

<p>Said Gen. C. B. Cates, Commandant of the Marine Corps:
"Leadership is intangible, hard to measure and difficult to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
describe. Its qualities would seem to stem from many factors.
But certainly they must include a measure of inherent ability
to control and direct, <em>self-confidence based on expert knowledge</em>,
initiative, loyalty, pride, <em>and a sense of responsibility</em>.
Inherent ability obviously cannot be instilled, but that which is
latent or dormant can be developed. Other ingredients can be
acquired. They are not easily taught or easily learned. <em>But
leaders can be and are made.</em> The average good man in our
service is and must be considered a potential leader."</p>

<p>There are common denominators in these two quotations
which clearly point in one main direction. When we accent the
importance of extra initiative, expert knowledge and a sense of
responsibility, we are saying in other words that out of unusual
application to duty comes the power to lead others in the doing
of it.</p>

<p>The matter is as simple and as profound as that, and if we
will consider for but a moment, we will see why it could hardly
be otherwise.</p>

<p>No normal young man is likely to recognize in himself the
qualities which will persuade others to follow him. On the other
hand, any man who can carry out orders in a cheerful spirit,
complete this work step by step, use imagination in improving it,
and then when the job is done, can face toward his next duty
with anticipation, need have no reason to doubt his own
capacity for leadership.</p>

<p>The psychologists assure us that there is a sound scientific
basis for what enlightened military trainers have long held to be
true&mdash;that the first-class follower and the leader are one and
the same. They say that this is literally true, and that their
tests prove it so.</p>

<p>But it does not follow that every man can be taught to lead.
In the majority of men, success or failure is caused more by
mental attitude than by mental capacity. Many are unwilling to
face the ordeal of thinking for themselves and of accepting
responsibility for others. But the man determined to excel at his
own work has already climbed the first rung of the ladder; in
that process he perforce learns to think for himself while set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>ting
an example to those who are around him. Out of application
to work comes capacity for original and creative progress.
The personality characteristics, emotional balance, etc., which
give him excellence in those things which he does with his own
brain and hand will enable him to command the respect, and in
turn, the service of other men.</p>

<p>To this extent, certainly leadership can be learned! It is a
matter of mastering simple techniques which will give more
effective expression to the character and natural talents of the
individual.</p>

<p>Said one of this Nation's great political leaders: "There is no
more valuable subordinate than the man to whom you can give
a piece of work and then forget it, in the confident expectation
that the next time it is brought to your attention it will come
in the form of a report that the thing has been done. When this
self-reliant quality is joined to executive power, loyalty and
common sense, the result is a man whom you can trust."</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, and that is as it should be. For while no man can
be sure of the possibilities of his influence over other men, every
man knows by his own conscience when he is putting forth his
best effort, and when he is slacking.</p>

<p>It is therefore not an arbitrary standard for measuring leadership
capacity in men which puts the ability to excel in assigned
work above everything else. The willingness and ability to strive,
and to do, are best judged by what we see of men in action. If
they are indifferent to assigned responsibilities, they are bad
risks for larger ones, no matter how charming their personalities
or what the record says about their prior experience and educational
advantages. Either that proposition is both reasonable
and sound, or Arnold Bennett was singing off key when he
said: "I think fine this necessity for the tense bracing of the
will before anything worth doing can be done. It is the chief
thing that distinguishes me from the cat by the fire."</p>

<p>Love of work is the sheet-anchor of the man who truly aspires
to command responsibilities; that means love of it, not
for the reward, or for the skill exercised, but for the final and
successful accomplishment of the work itself. For out of interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
in the job comes thoroughness, and it is this quality above all
which distinguishes the willing spirit. The willingness to learn,
to study and to try harder are requisite to individual progress
and the improvement of opportunity&mdash;the process that Thomas
Carlyle described as the "unfolding of one's self." Thus it can
be taken as an axiom that any man can lead who is determined
to become master of that knowledge which an increased responsibility
would require of him; and by the same token, that to
achieve maximum efficiency at one's own working level, it is
necessary to see it as if from the perspective of the next level up.
To excel in the management of a squad, the leader must be
knowledgeable of all that bears upon the command of a platoon.
Otherwise the mechanism lacks something of unity.</p>

<p>Mark Twain said at one point that we should be thankful for
the indolent, since but for them the rest of us could not get
ahead. That's on the target, and it emphasizes that how fast
and far each of us travels is largely a matter of free choice.</p>

<p>Personal advancement, within any worthwhile system, requires
some sacrifice of leisure, and more careful attention to the
better organization of one's working routine. But that does not
entail heroic self-sacrifice or the forfeiting of any of life's truly
enduring rewards. It means putting the completion of work
ahead of golf and bridge. It means rejecting the convenient
excuse for postponing solution of the problem until the next
time. It means cultivating the mind during hours that would
otherwise be spent in idleness. It means concentrating for longer
periods on the work at hand without getting up from one's
chair. But after all, these things do not require an extraordinary
faculty. The ability of the normal man to concentrate his
thought and effort are mainly the product of a personal conviction
that concentration is necessary and desirable. Abb&eacute; Dimnet
said: "Concentration is supposed to be exceptional only because
people do not try and, in this, as in so many things, starve
within an inch of plenty." And as to the mien and manner
which will develop from firm commitments, another wise
Frenchman, Honore Balzac, added this: "Conviction brings a
silent, indefinable beauty into faces made of the commonest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
human clay." Here is a great part of the secret. It is in the
exercise of the will that the men are separated from the boys,
and that the officer who is merely anxious for advancement is
put apart from the one who is truly ambitious to succeed in his
life calling. Even a lazy-minded superior, in judging of his
subordinates, will rarely mistake the one condition for the other.</p>

<p>When within the services we hear the highest praise reserved
for the man "with character," that is what the term means&mdash;application
to duty and thoroughness in all undertakings,
along with that maturity of spirit and judgment which comes by
precept, by kindness, by study, by watching, and above all, by
example. The numerous American commanders from all services
who have been accorded special honor because they rose
from the ranks have invariably made their careers by the extra
work, self-denial and rigor which the truly good man does not
hesitate to endure. The question facing every young officer is
whether he, too, is willing to walk that road for the rewards,
material and spiritual, which will surely attend it.</p>

<p>There is of course that commonest of excuses for rejecting
the difficult and taking life easy. "I haven't time!" But for the
man who keeps his mind on the object, there is always time.
Figure it out! About us in the services daily we see busy men
who somehow manage to find time for whatever is worth doing,
while at the adjoining desks are others with abundant leisure
who can't find time for anything. When something important
requires doing, it is usually the busy man who gets the call.</p>

<p>Of the many personal decisions which life puts upon a service
officer, the main one is whether he chooses to swim upstream.
If he says yes to that, and means it, all things then begin to fit
into place. Then will develop gradually but surely that well-placed
inner confidence which is the foundation of military
character. From the knowing of <em>what to do</em> comes the knowing
of <em>how to do</em>, which is likewise important. Much is conveyed in
few words in Army Field Forces' "Brief on Practical Concepts
of Leadership." It is stressed therein that the preeminent quality
which all great commanders have owned in common is a
<em>positiveness</em> of manner and of viewpoint, the power to concen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>trate
on means to a given end to the exclusion of exaggerated
fears of the obstacles which lie athwart the course. Every word
of that should be underscored, and above all, what it says
about the need for affirmative thinking, and concentrating on
how the thing can be done. The service is no place for those
who hang back and view through a glass darkly. The man who
falls into the vice of thinking negatively must perforce in time
become fearful of all action; he lacks the power of decision,
because it has been destroyed by his habit of thought, and even
when circumstances compel him to say yes he remains uncommitted
in spirit.</p>

<p>But the shadow should not be mistaken for the substance.
Positiveness of manner, and redoubtable inner conviction stem
only from the mastery of superior knowledge, and this last is the
fruit of application, preparation, thoroughness and the willingness
to struggle to gain the desired end.</p>

HUMAN NATURE</h3>


<p>In the history of American arms, the most revealing chapter
as to the nature of the human animal does not come from any
story of the battlefield but from the record of 23 white men and
two Eskimos who, on August 26, 1881, set up in isolation a
camp on the edge of Lady Franklin Bay to attempt a Farthest
North record for the United States.</p>

<p>The Expedition under command of First Lt. A. W. Greeley,
USA, expected to be picked up by a relief ship after 1 year, or
2 years at most. Its supply could be stretched to cover the
maximum period. But the winters were so unduly harsh that the
rescue mission could not break through the ice to keep the
rendezvous. During the first year, two members of the party had
set a new Far North mark. The party as a whole&mdash;3 officers,
19 enlisted men, 1 civilian surgeon and the 2 natives&mdash;had
survived a winter closer to the Pole than civilized men had ever
lived before. So doing, they had remained in reasonably good
personal adjustment to each other, despite the Arctic monotony.
The discipline of the camp had been strict. Rules of subordination,
sanitation, work-sharing and religious observance had been
maintained, without major friction occurring in the life of the
group. Lectures were given regularly, and schools were organized.
Though it is recorded that the men became melancholy,
sleepless, and irritable because of the long Arctic night, temper
was still in so good a state that an honor system within the
camp meted out extra duty to any man using an oath.</p>

<p>The comradely feeling remained alive within the party
throughout the first winter, though morale had its first blow
when Greeley issued an unwise order forbidding enlisted men to
go more than 500 yards from the base without permission. The
strain was beginning to tell, but there was no fatal rift in the
working harmony of the group while supply and hope remained
reasonably full.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>But June of the second year came and passed, and no relief
ship arrived. In August, Greeley decided on a retreat, intending
to fall back on bases which were supposed to hold food stores.
Thereafter disaster was piled upon disaster, most of it having to
do with the lack of food, and the varying animal and spiritual
reactions of men to a situation of utmost desperation. When the
Greeley Expedition was at last rescued at Cape Sabine on June
22, 1884, by the third expedition&mdash;the <em>Revenue Cutter Bear</em>
and the <em>Thetis</em> under Commander Winfield S. Schley, USN&mdash;only
seven men remained alive. Even in these, the spark of life
was so feeble that their tent was down over them and they had
resigned themselves to death. Two died soon after the rescue,
leaving five. Most of the other 20 had perished of slow starvation,
but not all. Some had been shot. Others had met death
with utmost bravery trying to save their failing comrades.</p>

<p>All that happened to Greeley's party during the months of its
terrible ordeal is known because of a diary which records the
main things&mdash;the fight of discipline against the primal instincts
in men, the reversion of the so-called civilized man to
his real type when he knows that death is at his elbow, the
strength of unity which comes of comradeship, and also the
weakness in some individuals which makes it impossible for
them to measure up to honor's requirements.</p>

<p>Men are of all kinds. Some remain base, though given every
opportunity to develop compassion. Others who may appear
plodding and dull, and have been denied opportunity, still have
in them an immortal spark of love for humanity which gives
them an unbreakable bond with their fellows in the hours of
crisis.</p>

<p>What the case history of the Greeley Expedition proves is that
<em>in the determining number of men, the potential is sound</em>.
Given a wise, understanding leadership, they will stand together,
and they will either persuade the others to go along, or they
will help break them if they resist. If that were not the truth of
the matter, no military commander in our time would be able
to make his forces keep going into battle.</p>

<p>Until the end, discipline was kept in Greeley's force. But this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
was not primarily due to Lieutenant Greeley, the aloof, strict
disciplinarian who commanded by giving orders, instead of by
trying to command the spirits and loyalties of men. That any
survived was due to the personal force and example of Sgt. (later
Brig. Gen.) David L. Brainard, who believed in discipline as
did Greeley, and supported his chief steadfastly, but also supplied
the human warmth and helping hand which rallied other
men, where Greeley's strictures only made them want to fight
back. Brainard was not physically the strongest man in the Expedition,
nor necessarily the most self-sacrificing and courageous.
But he had what counted most&mdash;mental and moral
balance.</p>

<p>Among the most fractious and self-centered of the individuals
was the camp surgeon, highly trained and educated, and chosen
because he seemed to have a way among men. Greeley was
several times at the point of having him shot; the surgeon's
death by starvation saved Greeley that necessity.</p>

<p>Among the most decent, trustworthy, and helpful was Jens,
the simple Eskimo, who died trying to carry out a rescue mission.
He had never been to school a day in his life.</p>

<p>There were soldiers in the party whom no threat of punishment,
or sense of pity, could deter from taking advantage of
their comrades, rifling stores, cheating on duty and even stealing
arms in the hope of doing away with other survivors.
When repeated offense showed that they were unreformable,
they were shot.</p>

<p>But in the greater number, the sense of pride and of honor
was stronger even than the instinct for self-preservation, though
these were <em>average</em> enlisted men, not especially chosen because
their records proved they had unusual fortitude.</p>

<p>Private Schneider, a youngster who loved dogs and played the
violin, succumbed to starvation after penning one of the most
revealing deathbed statements ever written: "Although I stand
accused of doing dishonest things here lately, I herewith, as a
dying man, can say that the only dishonest thing I ever did
was to eat my own sealskin boots and the part of my pants."</p>

<p>Private Fredericks, accused in the early and less-trying period<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of meanness and injustice to his comrades, became a rock of
strength in the weeks when all of the others were in physical
collapse or coma, and was made a sergeant because of the
nobility of his conduct. Yet this man's ambition was to be a
saloonkeeper in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>There is still an official report on file in the Department of
the Army which describes Sergeant Rice as the "bravest and
noblest" of the Expedition. He is identified with most of its
greatest heroisms. The man was apparently absolutely indomitable
and incorruptible. He died from freezing on a last forlorn
mission into the Arctic storm to retrieve a cache of seal meat
for his friends. Fredericks, who had accompanied him, was so
grief-stricken at the tragedy that he contemplated dying at his
side, then reacted in a way which signifies much in a few
words, "Out of the sense of duty I owed my dead comrade, I
stooped and kissed the remains and left them there for the
wild winds of the Arctic to sweep over."</p>

<p>Such briefly were the extremes and the middle ground in this
body of human material. At one end were the amoral characters
whose excesses became steadily worse as the situation blackened.
At the other were Brainard and Rice&mdash;good all the way
through, absolute in integrity and adjusted perfectly to other
men. In between these wholly contrasting elements was the
group majority, trying to do duty, with varying degrees of success.
That would include Greeley, strong in self-discipline but
likewise brittle. It would include Lieutenant Lockwood, a lion
among men for most of the distance, but totally downcast and
beaten in the last dreadful stretch, Israel, the youngest of the
party who won the love of other men by his frankness and
generosity, Sergeant Gardiner who was always ready to share his
scraps of food with whoever he thought needed them more,
Private Whisler who died begging his comrades to forgive him
for having stolen a few slices of bacon, and Private Bender who
alternated between feats of heroism and acts of miscreancy.</p>

<p>Other than their common experience, there was probably
nothing unusual about this group of men. They were an average
slice of American manpower as found in the services of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
day, and in the fundamentals, men have changed but little since.
Those who had the chance to study American men under the
terrible rigor of Japanese imprisonment during World War II
give an analysis not unlike the chronicles of the Greeley party.
In certain of the prisoners, character, and sanity with it, held
fast against every circumstance. In others, some of whom had
been well educated and came from gentle homes, the brute instinct
was as uppermost as in an East African cannibal.</p>

<p>From such crucibles as these, even more than from the remittent
stresses of combat in war, comes the clearest light on
the inner nature of man, insofar as it needs to be understood by
the officer who may some day lead a force into battle.</p>

<p>Snap judgment on the data might lead to the conclusion
that every individual is exactly according to his own mould,
that influence from without can not catalyze character, and
that hence training has little to do with winning loyalty and instilling
dutifulness. That would be as radically false as to believe
that training, when properly conducted, can make all men
alike and can infuse all ranks with the desire for a high standard.
The vanity of that hope can be read out of what happened
to the force at Cape Sabine. But the positive lesson glows even
more strongly. The good Sergeant, Brainard, wrote of his Lieutenant,
Lockwood, that he "loved him more than a brother."
It was the service which taught him the worth of that attachment;
Brainard's superb courage developed initially out of his
unbounded admiration for Lockwood's dauntlessness, and in
time the copyist outdistanced the model. Emotionally, Greeley
and Brainard were quite unlike. One was a New England Puritan,
the other a hard-boiled sergeant. But they became as one
in the interests of the force; service training had made that
possible.</p>

<p>Psychologists tell us that every sense impression leaves a trace
or imprint of itself on the mind, or in other words, what we
are, and what we may become, is influenced in some measure by
everything touching the circumference of our daily lives. The
imprints become memories and ideas, and in their turn build up
the consciousness, the reason and finally the will, which trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>lates
into physical action the psychological purpose. In the process,
moral character may be shaped and strengthened; but it
will not be transformed if it is dross in the first place. That is
something which every combat leader has learned in his tour
under fire; the man of whom nobody speaks good, who is regarded
as a social misfit, unliked and unliking, of his comrades,
will usually desert them under pressure. There are others
who have the right look but will be just as quick to quit, and
look to themselves, in a crisis; underneath, they are made of the
same shoddy stuff as the derelict, but have learned a little more
of the modern art of getting by. Leadership, be it ever so inspired,
can not make a silk purse from a sow's ear. But as shines
forth in the record of Greeley and his men, it can reckon with
the fact that the majority is more good than mean, and that
from this may be developed the strength of the whole. In the
clutch, the men at Cape Sabine who believed in the word "duty,"
and who understood spiritually that its first meaning was mutual
responsibility, remained joined in an insoluble union. That
was the inevitable outcome, leadership doing its part. The
minority had no basis for organic solidarity, as each of its number
was motivated only by self-interest. Goodwill and weakness
may be combined in one man; bad will and strength in another.
High moral leading can lift the first man to excel himself; it
will not reform the other. But there is no other sensible rule
than that all men will be approached with trust, and treated as
trustworthy until proved otherwise beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>To transfer this thought to even the largest element in war,
it will be seen that <em>it is not primarily a cause which makes men
loyal to each other, but the loyalty of men to each other which
makes a cause</em>. The unity which develops from man's recognition
of his dependence upon his fellows is the mainspring of
every movement by which society, or any autonomy within it,
moves forward.</p>

<p>It is a common practice to say "Men are thus-and-so."
Nothing is more attractive than to make some glittering generalization
about the human race, and from it draw a moral for
the instruction of those who work with human material. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
from all that we have learned from the experience of men
under inordinate pressure, either in war or wherever else military
forces have been sorely tested, it would be false to say
either that the desire for economic security or the instinct for
self-preservation is the driving force in every man's action. To
those who possess the strength of the strong, honor is the main
shaft; and they can carry a sufficient number of the company
along with them to stamp their mark upon whatever is done
by the group. No matter what their personal strength, however,
they too are dependent on the others. There is no possibility of
growth for any man except through the force, and by the works
of those about him, though the manner of his growth is partly
a matter of free choice. To most men, the setting of the good
example is a challenge to pride and a stimulus to action. To
nearly every member of the race, confidence and inspiration
come mainly from the influence which living associates have
upon them. That training is most perfect which takes greatest
advantage of this truth, employing it in balance toward the development
of a spirit of comradeship and the doing of work
with a manifestly military purpose. Peace training is war training
and nothing less. There is no other basis for the efficient
operation of military forces even when the skies are clear. <em>But
no commander or instructor can convince men of the decisive
importance of the object if he himself regards it as only an
intellectual exercise.</em></p>

<p>The Army's "Brief on Practical Concepts of Leaderships,"
published 1 January 1950, well points out the desirability of
leaders realizing it is vain to expect that training can bring men
forward uniformly. The better men advance rapidly; the men of
average attainments remain average; the below-average lose additional
ground to the competition. In consequence, the chance
for balance in the organizational structure depends upon the
leader progressing in such close knowledge of his men that
those who are strong in various aspects of the team's general
requirements compensate for the weaknesses of others, irrespective
of MOS numbers. It is not less essential that the followers
know each other and prepare themselves to complement each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
other. Obviously, this cannot be done when personnel changes
are so frequent that those concerned have no chance to see
deeper than the surface.</p>

<p>Even when to do any labor meant sapping the small store of
energy deriving from a few ounces of food each day, Greeley's
men kept alive the spark of morale and mutual support by
maintaining a work schedule, until the day came when there
was no longer a man who could stand. To fight off despondency,
they held to a nightly schedule of lectures and discussions
in their rude shelters, until speech became an agony because of
throats poisoned by eating of caterpillars, lichens and saxifrage
blossoms. In their worst extremity, Private Fredericks, unlettered
but a man of great common sense and moral power, became
the doctor, cook and forager for the party.</p>

<p>Men do not achieve a great solidarity, or preserve it, simply
by <em>being</em> together. Their mutual bonds are forged only by <em>doing</em>
together that which they have been made convinced is constructive.
Their view of its importance is usually contingent
upon what others tell them, and upon a continuing emphasis
thereof. <em>Unity is all at one time a consequence of, and a cause
and condition for great accomplishment.</em> Toward that end, it
is neither vital nor desirable that all members of the group coincide
in their motives, ideas and methods of expression. What is
important is that each man should know, and to a reasonable
extent incorporate into his own life the thoughts, desires and
interests of the others. Such sentiments, fixed by repetition, remain
as a habit during the life of the group, and provide the
base for disciplined action. But when men are not thus drawn
together and the cord of sympathy remains unstrung, there is no
basis for control, nor any element of contact by which the
group may identify itself with some larger entity and profit by
transfusion of its moral strength.</p>

<p><em>The absence of a common purpose is the chief source of unhappiness
in any collection of individuals.</em> Lacking it, and the
common standard of justice which is one of its chief agents,
men become more and more separate units, each fighting for
his own rights. Yet paradoxically, if an organic unity is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
develop within any body of free men, drawn from a free society
to serve its military institutions, and if the fairest use is to be
made of their possibilities, the processes of the institution must
embody respect for the dignity of the individual, for his rights,
and not less, for his desire for worthwhile recognition. The
profile of every man depends upon the space which others leave
him. "Of himself," said Napoleon, "a man is nothing." But
every man also contributes with his every act to the level of what
his group may attain. One of the foremost leaders in the United
States Navy in World War II said this about the integrity of
personality: "Every person is unique. Human talents were never
before assembled in exactly the same way that they have been
put together in yourself. Nothing like you ever happened before.
No one can predict with accuracy how you will grow in
your particular combination of skills if allowed complete freedom
of movement." If there is one word out of place in that
statement, it is "complete;" no one has complete freedom but a
buccaneer, and it is for the exercise of it that organized society
swings him from a gibbet. It is only when personal freedom of
action operates within an area limited by the rights and welfare
of others that subordination, in its best sense, takes place. To
direct a body of men toward the acceptance of this principle,
so that thereby they may attain social coherence as a group and
greater strength of personal character, is the most solid contribution
that an officer can make to the arms of his country.</p>

<p>He can succeed in this without being godlike in wisdom or
pluperfect in temper. But it is necessary at least that he be interesting,
and that he know how to get out of his own tracks,
lest he be over-run by his own organization. Whatever his
rank, <em>it is impossible for any man to lead if he is himself running
behind</em>. This bespeaks the need of constant study, the constant
use of one's personal powers and the exercise of the
imagination. As men advance, that which was good soon ceases
to be good simply because something better is possible. Once
men begin to acquire a sense of organization, they also come to
take the measure of those who are over them. They will then
move instinctively toward the one man who possesses the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>est
measure of social energy. The accolade of leadership is not
inherent in the individual but is conferred on him by the
group. It does not always follow that a man can develop an
influence with others which is proportionate to his talents and
capacity for work. Leadership in work is a main requirement,
but if the group does not warm toward the appointed leader,
if its members can not feel any enthusiasm about him, they will
be hypercritical of whatever he does.</p>

<p>History confirms, and a study of the workings of the human
mind supports one proposition which many of the great captains
of war have accepted as a truism. "There are no bad troops:
there are only bad leaders." Taking on percentage what we already
know of our average American raw material, as it had
proved itself in every war, and as it has been studied in such a
laboratory as the camp at Cape Sabine, no exception can be
taken to that statement. On the other hand, we know equally
well that leadership can be taught and it can be acquired.
Much of our best material lies fallow, awaiting a hand on the
shoulder, and the touch of other men's confidence, before it
can step forward. This is not because men with a sound potential
for leading must necessarily have an outward air of modesty
among their major virtues, but because a man&mdash;particularly
a young man&mdash;cannot gain a sense of his power among his
fellows except as they give him their confidence, and vivify his
natural desire to be something better than the average. There
is no indication that at any stage of his career Gen. George S.
Patton was an outwardly modest man. But in reviewing the
milestones in his own making, he underscored the occasion
when General Pershing, then commanding the Punitive Expedition
into Mexico, supported Lieutenant Patton's judgment
against that of a major. These are his words: "My act took
high moral courage and built up my self-confidence." It would
seem altogether clear, however, that Pershing had more than a
little to do with it. Col. W. T. Sherman had to be kindled by
the warm touch of Mr. Lincoln and steeled by the example and
strong faith of Gen. U. S. Grant before he could believe in his
own capacity for generalship. We all live by information and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
not by sight. We exist by faith in others, which is the source
toward knowing greater faith in ourselves.</p>

<p>About the elements of human nature, it is good that an
officer should know enough that he will be able to win friends
and influence people. But it is folly to believe that he should
pursue his studies in this subject until he habitually looks at
men as would a scientist putting some specimen under a powerful
microscope.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness is by no means a serious fault in anyone
confronted by a new set of responsibilities, and working among
new companions. There is scarcely an officer who has not felt
it, particularly in the beginning, before he is assured in his own
presence. But if the greater part of the officer corps were ever to
become absorbed in the business of taking men apart to see what
makes them tick, thereby superinducing self-consciousness all
down the line, an irremediable blight would come upon the
services. There is no need to look that deeply. What matters
mainly is that an officer will know how men are won to accept
authority, how they can be made to unify their own strength,
how they can be helped to find satisfaction and success in their
employment, how the stronger men can be chosen for preferment
from among them, and finally, how they can be conditioned
to face the realities of combat.</p>

<p>The chronicles of effective military leadership date back to
Gideon and his Band. Therefore any notion that it is impossible
for an officer to make the best use of his men unless he is armed
with all available research data and can talk the language of the
philosopher and modern social scientist is little more than a
twentieth century conceit. To seek and use all pertinent information
is commendable, but truth comes of seeing all things in
their natural proportion. To know more than is necessary blunts
one's own weapons. The application of common sense to the
problem is more vital than the possession of an inexhaustible
store of data which has no practical bearing upon the matter at
hand. As was said by a philosopher three centuries ago: "It is
remarkable in some that they could be so much better if they
could but be better in some thing."</p>

GROUP NATURE</h3>


<p>In the same way that knowledge of individual nature becomes
the key to building strength within the group, an understanding
of crowd nature is essential to the preservation of the unique
power within the group, particularly under conditions of extreme
pressure.</p>

<p>Whereas the central object of a training discipline is to raise
a safeguard against any military body reverting to crowd form
under trial by fire, history shows that paralysis both of leadership
and of the ranks, obliviousness to orders, forgetfulness of
means of communication, disintegration and even panic are the
not uncommon reactions of military forces when first entering
into battle.</p>

<p>From Bunker Hill and Brandywine down to Pearl Harbor and
the fight at Kasserine Pass, the American battle record shows
that our own troops are by no means immune to these ill effects,
and that our peace time training needs, therefore, always to be
reappraised with a critical eye to the main issue.</p>

<p>Any of these unsteadying reactions can be prevented, or at
least minimized, by training which anticipates the inevitable
disorders of battle&mdash;including those who are of material sort
as well as the disorders of the mind&mdash;and acclimates men to
the realities of the field in war. All may be averted if leadership
is braced to the shock and prepared to exercise strong control.
Indeed, it is a truth worthy of the closest regard that the greater
number of the disarrangements which take place during
combat are due to leadership feeling a tightening of the throat,
and a sticking of the palate, and failing to do that which the
intellect says should be done.</p>

<p>To take any action, when even to think of action is itself
difficult, is the essential step toward recovery and the surmounting
of all difficulty. It is not because of a babel of mixed voices
and commands that military bodies not infrequently relapse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
into helplessness and stagnation in the face of the enemy.
From that cause there may occur an occasional minor dislocation.
Their total effect is trivial compared to the failures which
come of leadership, at varying levels, failing promptly to exercise
authority when nothing else can resolve the situation.
Among the commonest of experiences in war is to witness troops
doing nothing, or worse, doing the wrong thing, without one
commanding voice being raised to give them direction. In such
circumstance, any man who has the nerve and presence to step
forward and give them an intelligent order in a manner indicating
that he expects to be obeyed, will be accepted as a
leader and will be given their support.</p>

<p>For this reason, under the conditions of modern battle, the
coherence of any military body comes not only of men being
articulate all down the line but of building up the dynamic
power in each individual. It is a thoroughly sound exercise in
any unit to give every man a chance to take charge, and give
orders in drill, or other limited exercises, once he had learned
what the orders mean. By the same token, it is good practice
for the junior leader to displace a file in a training exercise, and
become commanded for a time, to sharpen his own perspective.</p>

<p>Progress comes of making the most of our strengths rather
than looking for ways to repair weaknesses. This is true in
things both large and small. The platoon leader who permits
himself to be bedeviled by the file who won't or can't keep step
cannot do justice to the ambitions of the 10 strongest men
beneath him, upon whom the life of the formation would depend,
come an emergency. To nourish and encourage the top
rather than to concentrate effort and exhaust nerves in trying to
correct the few least likely prospects is the healthy way of
growth within military organization.</p>

<p>Not all men are fitted by nature for the precisions of life in a
barracks. They may accept its discipline while not being able
to adjust to its rhythm. The normal temptation to despair of
them needs to be resisted if only for the reason experience has
proved they sometimes make the best men in combat. There
are many types which fit into this category&mdash;the foreigner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
but recently arrived in America, the miner who has spent most
of his years underground, the boy from the sticks who has known
only the plough and furrow, the woodsman, the reservation
Indian, and the men of all races who have had hard taskmasters
or other misfortune in their civilian sphere, and expect
to be hurt again. It is not unusual for this kind of material to
show badly in training because of an ingrained fear of other
men. At the same time, they can face mortal danger. <em>To
harass the man who is trying, but can't quite do it, therefore
cuts double against the strength of organization. It may ruin
the man; it may also give his comrades the feeling that he isn't
getting a decent break.</em></p>

<p>The military crowd requires, above all, maturity of judgment
in its leaders. It cannot be patronized safely. Nor can it be
treated in the classroom manner, as if wisdom were being dispensed
to schoolboys. When it has been remiss, it expects to
catch unshirted hell for its failings, and though it may smart
under a just bawling out, it will feel let down if the commander
quibbles. But any officer puts himself on a skid, and impairs
the strength of his unit, if he takes to task all hands
because of the wilful failings of a minority. Strength comes to
men when they feel that they are grown up and as a body are
in control and under control, since it amounts to the same
thing; it is only when men unite toward a common purpose
that control becomes possible. In this respect, the servant is in
fact the master of the situation, fully realizes it, and is not
unprepared to accept proportionate responsibility.</p>

<p>It is a sign of a good level of discipline in a command when
orders are given and faithfully carried out. But it is a sign of a
vastly superior condition when men are prepared to demand
those orders which they know the situation requires, if it is to
be helped. No competent subordinate sits around waiting for
someone else to give impulse to movement if his senses tell him
that things are going to pot. He either suggests a course of
action to his superior, or asks authority to execute it on his own,
or in the more desperate circumstances of the battlefield, gives
orders on his own initiative. To counsel any lesser theory of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
individual responsibility than this would leave every chain of
command at the complete mercy of its weakest link, and
throughout the general establishment, would choke the fount
of inspiration which comes of the upward thrust of energy and
of ideas.</p>

<p>This latter characteristic in the masses of men composing any
organization is the final statement of moral responsibility for
success. Within military forces, an element of command is owned
by every man who is doing his duty with intelligence and
imagination. That puts him on the side of the angels, and the
pressure which he exerts is felt not only by his subordinates but
by those topside who are doing less. Many a lazy skipper has
snapped out of it and at last begun to level with his organization
because he felt the hot breath of a few earnest subordinates
on his neck. Many a battle unit has held to ground which it
had been ready to forsake because of the example of an aid man
who stayed at his work and refused to forsake the wounded.
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower was thinking on these things when
he said during World War II: "There is among the mass of
individuals who carry rifles in war a great amount of ingenuity
and efficiency. If men can talk naturally to their officers, the
product of their resourcefulness becomes available to all." But
the art of open communication requires both receiving and sending,
and the besetting problem is to get officers to talk naturally
to men.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century Marshal Maurice de Saxe rediscovered
cadenced marching which, along with the hard-surfaced
roads of France, had remained buried since the time of the
Romans. He reinstituted precision marching and drill within
military bodies, and by that action changed European armies
from straggling mobs into disciplined troops. The effects of that
reform have been felt right down to the present. Baron von
Steuben, the great reorganizer of the forces in George Washington's
Army, simply built upon the principles which de Saxe had
set forth one century earlier. These two great architects of military
organization founded their separate systems upon one controlling
idea&mdash;that <em>if men can be trained to think about mov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>ing
together, they can then be led to move toward thinking together</em>.
De Saxe wanted keen men, not automatons; in that, he
was singular among the captains of his day. He started the numbering
of regiments so that they would have a continuing history
and thereby benefit from <em>esprit de corps</em>. He was the first to see
the great importance of battle colors and to standardize their
use. Of his own military opinions he wrote: "Experts should not
be offended by the assurance with which I deliver my opinions.
They should correct them; that is the fruit I expect from my
work."</p>

<p>Now to take a look at von Steuben. He was the drillmaster of
the American Revolution, but he was also its greatest student of
the human mind and heart. He wrote the drill regulations of the
Army, and as he wrote, committed them to memory. Of his labors
he said: "I dictated my dispositions in the night; in the
day I had them performed." But he learned the nature of the
human material for which he thought these exercises were suited
by visiting the huts of the half-clad soldiers of Valley Forge,
personally inspecting their neglected weapons and hearing from
their own lips of their sufferings. His main technic in installing
his system was to depend upon the appeal of a powerful
example; to allay all doubt of exactly what was wanted, he
formed a model company and drilled it himself. He was a
natural man; troops warmed to him because of an unabashed
use of broken English and his violently explosive use, under
stress, of "gottam!" which was his only quasi-English oath. In
countenance he was strikingly like Gen. George S. Patton and
there were other points of resemblance. A private soldier at
Valley Forge was impressed with "the trappings of his pistols,
the enormous holsters of his pistols, his large size, his strikingly
martial aspect." But while he liked to dine with great men at
his table, he chose to complete his list with officers of inferior
rank. Once at Valley Forge he permitted his aides to give a
dinner for junior officers on condition that none should be admitted
that had on a whole pair of breeches. This was making
the most of adversity. While wearing two stars and serving as
Inspector General of the Army, he would still devote his whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
day to the drilling of a squad of 10 or 12 men to get his system
going. To a former Prussian associate he wrote this of Americans:
"You say to your soldier, 'Do this!' and he doeth it; but
I am obliged to say, 'This is the reason that you ought to do
that,' and then he does it."</p>

<p>This was the key to the phenomenal success of his system.
Within 6 weeks after he began work at Valley Forge, the Continental
Army was on a new footing of self-confidence. His
personal diligence in inquiring into the conduct of all officers
toward their men, and his zeal in checking the accoutrement
and carriage of every soldier established within the Army its
first standard of inspection. Officers began to divide their scant
rations with their men so that they would look better. But
though he drilled the men of Valley Forge in marching and
maneuver, Steuben paid no attention to the manual of arms,
and let that wait until after he had gone into battle with these
same forces. He explained why in these words: "Every colonel
had introduced a system of his own and those who had taken
the greatest pains were naturally the most attached to their
work. Had I destroyed their productions, they would have detested
me. I therefore preferred to pay no special attention to
this subject until I had won their confidence." To take hold at
the essential point and postpone action on the relatively unimportant,
to respect a worthy pride and natural dignity in other
men, and finally, to demonstrate that there is a better way in
order to win men's loyalty and to use loyalty as the portal to
more constructive collective thought&mdash;all of these morals shine
in this one object lesson. The most revealing light upon the
character of Steuben comes of the episode in which he had one
Lieutenant Gibbons arrested for an offense, which he later
learned another had committed. He then went before the Regiment.
It was raining hard, but he bared his head and asked
Gibbons to come forward. "Sir," he said, "the fault which was
committed might, in the presence of an enemy, have been fatal.
Your Colonel tells me you are blameless. I ask your pardon.
Return to your command."</p>

<p>Mistakes will occur. Tempers will go off half-cocked even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
among men of good habit. Action will be taken on impulse
rather than full information, despite every warning as to its
danger. But no officer who has ever done serious injustice to a
subordinate can do less than Steuben did, if he wants to keep
respect. Admiral Halsey wrote about how he had once relieved
one of his Captains in battle, found months later that he had
misjudged him, and then tried by every means within his power
to make redress.</p>

<p>The main connecting link between the perfecting of group
action in training and the end product of unity and economy
of operations in battle has never been better than imperfectly
expressed even by such masters as de Saxe and von Steuben,
who felt it by profound instinct. The time-honored explanation
is that when men accustom themselves to obeying orders, the
time ultimately arrives when they will obey by habit, and that
the habit will carry over into any set of circumstances requiring
response to orders. This has the quality of relative truth; it
is true so far as it goes, but it undersells the major values.</p>

<p>The heterogeneous crowd is swayed by the voices of instinct.
Properly trained, any military unit, being a homogeneous body,
should be swayed by the voice of training. Out of uniformity of
environment comes uniformity of character and spirit. From
moving and acting together men grow to depend upon, and to
support, each other, and to subordinate their individual wills
to the will of the leader. And if that were all that training
profited them, they would rarely win a battle or a skirmish
under modern conditions!</p>

<p>Today the supreme value of any training at arms which fixes
habit is that, under conditions of absolute pressure, it enables
men to take the primary steps essential to basic security without
too great taxing of their mental faculties and moral powers; this
leaves their senses relatively free to cope with the unexpected.
The unforeseen contingency invariably happens in battle, and
its incidence supplies the supreme test of the efficacy of any
training method. Surprise has no regard for the importance of
rank; in combat any unit's fortune may pivot on the judgment
and initiative of the file who has last joined it. Therefore the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
moral object in training is stated without any qualification in
words once used by a wise Frenchman, Dr. Maurice Campeaux:
"<em>It should be the subordination of the individual's will to the
leader's, and not its surrender or destruction.</em>" All training at
all levels has a dual object&mdash;to develop us all as leaders of
men and followers of leaders. Its technics are most perfect when
they serve evenly these parallel purposes. In consequence, when
any officer thinks only on: "What is policy?" rather than:
"What should policy be for the good of the service?" he has
trained his sights too low.</p>

<p>Even in modern warfare, however, there are exceptional circumstances
in which success is altogether dependent upon the
will and judgment of the leader, and undeviating response to
his orders. The commander of a buttoned-up tank is the master
of its fortunes, and what happens for better or worse is according
to the strength of his personal control. Within a submerged
submarine during action, the situation is still more remarkable.
Only one man, the commander of the ship, can see what is
occurring, and he only with one eye; the resolving of every
situation depends on his judgment as to what should be done.
Yet those who have the surest knowledge of this service have
said that the main problem in submarine warfare is to find a
sufficient body of officers who will rise superior to the intricacies
of their complicated machines, and will make their own
opportunities and take advantage of them. That is hardly
unique. The same quality is the hallmark of greatness in any
individual serving with a combat arm. The military crowd will
double its effort for a leader when success rides on his coattails;
but he needs first to capture their loyalty by keeping his contracts
with them, sweetening the ties of organization, and convincing
them that he is a man to be followed. His luck (which
despite all platitudes to the contrary is an element in success)
begins when his men start to believe that he was born under a
lucky star. But they are not apt to be so persuaded unless he can
make his outfit shine in comparison with all others. The best
argument for establishing a low VD score and a high disciplinary
and deportment record within any unit is that it convinces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
higher authority that the unit is well run and is trying, and is
therefore entitled to any extra consideration that may be requested.
All who have been closely identified with the inner
working of any higher headquarters in the American establishment
know that it works this way. On the other hand, the
fundamental idea is almost as old as the hills. Turning back
to Cicero, we will find these words: "Neither the physician nor
the general can ever, however praiseworthy he may be in the
theory of his art, perform anything highly worthwhile without
experience in the rules laid down for the observation of all
small duties." The Old Roman added that between men nothing
is so binding as a similarity of good dispositions.</p>

<p>Within the military crowd, and granting to each the same
quality of human material, the problem of achieving organic
unity in the face of the enemy is one thing on a ship, and quite
another among land-fighting forces. Loyalty to the ship itself
provides an extra and incisive bond among naval forces. Given
steadiness in the command, men will fight the ship to the limit,
if only for the reason that if they fail to do so, there is no place
to go but down. The physical setting of duty is defined by
material objects close at hand. The individual has only to fit
himself into an already predetermined frame. He knows when
he is derelict, and he knows further that his dereliction can
hardly escape the eye of his comrades. The words: "Now Hear
This!" have the particular significance that they bespeak the
collected nature of naval forces, and the essential unifying force
of complete communications.</p>

<p>If the situation were as concrete, and the integrating influences
as pervading among field forces as in the Navy, land
warfare would be relieved of a great part of its frictions. Except
among troops defending a major fortress with all-around protection,
there is no such possibility. Field movement is always
diffusing. As fire builds up against the line, its members have
less and less a sense of each other, and a feeling that as individuals
they are getting support. Each man is at the mercy of
the contact with some other file, and when the contact breaks,
he sees only blackness in the enveloping situation. Men then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
have to turn physically back toward each other to regain the
feeling of strength which comes of organization. That, in brief,
is the mathematical and psychological reason why salients into
an enemy line invariably take the form of a wedge; it comes of
the movements of unnerved and aimless men huddling toward
each other like sheep awaiting the voice of the shepherd. The
natural instincts intervene ever in the absence of strong leadership.
Said the French General de Maud'huy: "However perfectly
trained a company may be it always tends to become once
again the crowd when suddenly shocked."</p>

<p>But the priceless advantage which may be instilled in the
military crowd by a proper training is that it also possesses the
means of recovery. That possibility&mdash;the resolution of order out
of chaos&mdash;reposes within every file who has gained within the
service a confidence that he has some measure of influence
among his fellows. The welfare of the unit machinery depends
upon having the greatest possible number of human shock absorbers&mdash;men
who in the worst hour are capable of stepping
forward and saying: "This calls for something extra and that
means me." The restoration of control upon the battlefield, and
the process of checking fright and paralysis and turning men
back to essential tactical duties, does not come simply of constituted
authority again finding its voice and articulating its
strength to the extremities of the unit boundary. Control is a
man-to-man force under fire. No matter how lowly his rank, any
man who controls himself contributes to the control of others. A
private can steady a general as surely as a cat can look at a
king. There is no better ramrod for the back of a senior, who is
beginning to buckle, than the sight of a junior who has kept
his nerve. Land battles, as to the fighting part, are won by the
intrepidity of men in grade from private to captains mainly.
Fear is contagious but courage is not less so. The courage of any
one man reflects in some degree the courage of all those who are
within his vision. To the man who is in terror and bordering on
panic, no influence can be more steadying than that of seeing
some other man near him who is retaining self-control and
doing his duty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>The paralysis which comes of fear can be lifted only through
the resumption of action which will again give individuals the
feeling of organization. This does not mean ordering a bayonet
charge, or the firing of a volley at such-and-such o'clock. It
may mean only patting one man on the back, "talking it up"
to a couple of others, sending someone out to find a flank, or
turning one's self to dig-in, while passing the word to others to
do likewise. This is action in the realest sense of the term. <em>Out
of reinvigorating men toward the taking of many small actions
develops the possibility of large and decisive action.</em> The unit
must first find itself before doing an effective job of finding the
enemy. Out of those acts which are incidental to the establishing
of order, a leader reaffirms his own power of decision.</p>

<p>Such things are elementary, and of the very nature of the
fire fight. While there is much more to be said about the play of
moral forces in the trial and success of the group under combat
conditions, most of it is to be learned from other sources, and
it is the duty of every officer to study all that he can of this
subject, and apply it to what he does in his daily rounds.</p>

<p><em>There is no rule pertaining to the moral unifying of military
forces under the pressures of the battlefield which is not equally
good in the training which conditions troops for this eventuality.</em>
For the group to feel a great spiritual solidarity, and for its
members to be bound together by mutual confidence and the
satisfactions of a rewarding comradeship, is the foundation of
great enterprise. But it is not more than that. Unaccompanied
by a strengthening of the military virtues and a rise in the
martial spirit, a friendly unity will not of itself point men directly
toward the main object in training, nor enable them to dispose
themselves efficiently toward each other on entering battle.</p>

<p>It does not make the military man less an agent of peace and
more a militarist that he relishes his membership within a fighting
establishment and thinks those thoughts which would best
put his arms to efficient use. The military establishment neither
declares nor makes war; these are acts by the nation. But it is
the duty of the military establishment primarily to succor the
nation from any great jeopardy.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_THIRTEEN" id="CHAPTER_THIRTEEN"></a><span class="chapter_number">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</span><br /><br />

ENVIRONMENT</h3>


<p>The saying of the Old Sergeant that, "It takes a war to knock
the hell out of the Regular Army," applies as broadly to war's
effects upon the general peacetime establishment.</p>

<p>In the rapid expansion of the armed service which comes of a
national emergency, nothing seems to remain the same. Old
units fill up, and change their character. By the time they have
sent out three or four cadres of commissioned and enlisted
leaders to form the base for entirely new organizations, little
remains of the moral foundation of the parent unit except an
honored name.</p>

<p>Promotion is rapid and moves are frequent among the higher
commanders. No sooner does a man feel fairly settled under a
new commander, and confident that he will get along, than he
looks up to see someone else filling the space.</p>

<p>Installations grow like mushrooms. Schools multiply at a
phenomenal rate. The best qualified men are taken away so that
they will become better qualified, either by taking an officers'
course or through specialist training. Their places are taken by
men who may have an equal native ability, but haven't yet
mastered the tricks of the trade. This piles high the load of
work on those who command.</p>

<p>The intake and the pipelines in all services fill with men of
a quite different fiber and outlook than those which commonly
pass through the peacetime training establishment.</p>

<p>Particularly in the drafts which flow to the army there is a
curious mixture of the good with the bad. The illiterates, the
low IQs and the men who are physically a few notches below
par are passed for service, though under normal conditions the
recruiting standards shut them out. At the other end of the
scale are the highly educated men from the colleges, and the
robust individuals from the factory and farm. In natural quality
they are as well suited to the service as any who seek it out in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
peacetime, but in disposition they are likely to be a little less
tractable. On the whole, however, there is no radical difference
between them, if we look at both groups simply as training
problems for the study of the officer.</p>

<p>In the midst of war, when all else is in flux, at least one thing
stands fast. The methods, the self-discipline, and the personality
which will best enable the officer to command efficiently during
peace are identical with the requirements which fit him to
shape new material most perfectly under the conditions of war.</p>

<p>This is only another way of saying that for his own success, in
addition to the solid qualities which win him the respect of
other men, when war comes, he needs a vast adaptability and a
confidence which will carry over from one situation to another,
or he will have no peace of mind.</p>

<p>It is only to the man who is burdened with unnecessary and
exaggerated fears, and who mistakes for a fancied security the
privilege of sitting quietly in one place, that the uprooting
which comes with war is demoralizing. The natural officer sees
it as an hour of opportunity, and though he may not like
anything else about war, he at least relishes the strong feeling
of personal contention which always develops when there are
many openings inviting many men. As one World War II
commander expressed it: "During war the ball is always kicking
around loose in the middle of the field and any man who has
the will may pick it up and run with it."</p>

<p>Promotion, however, and the invitation to try one's hand at
some greater venture, do not come automatically to an officer
because of the onset of war. The man who had marked time on
his job becomes relatively worse off, not only because the competition
is keener, but because in lieu of anything which marks
him for preferment, there is no good reason why he should get
it. Years of service are not to a man's credit short of some
positive proof that the years have been well used. The following
are among the reasons why certain officers are marked for
high places and find the door wide open, come an emergency:</p>


<ul>
<li>A consistently superior showing in the efficiency reports.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
A record showing that they have done well in service schools.</li>

<li>The ability to attract the eye of some high-placed superior by
exceptional performance on maneuvers, in committee work or
any other testing problem.</li>

<li>In addition to general dutifulness, the development to a conspicuous
degree of the special talents such as writing, instructing,
lecturing and staff administration.</li>

<li>Fluency in other languages.</li>

<li>Wide and resourceful study in the fields of military history,
military geography, national military policy and logistics.</li>

<li>The advancement of an original idea which has led to a
general improvement in any one service.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any and all of these are extra strings to one's bow. They are
the means to greater satisfaction during peacetime employment
and the source of great personal advantage during the shooting
season. But they should not be mistaken for the main thing. <em>To
excell in command, and to be recognized as deserving of it, is
the rightful ambition of every service officer and his main hold
on the probabilities of getting wider recognition.</em></p>

<p>This holds true of the man who is so patently a specialist
that it would be wrong to waste him in a command responsibility.
If he understands the art of command, and his personality
and moral fortitude fit him for the leading of men, he will
be in better adjustment with his circumstances anywhere in the
services, and will be given greater respect by his superiors.
This rule is so absolute in its workings as to warrant saying that
<em>every man who wears the insignia of an officer in the armed
forces of the United States should aspire to the same bearing
and the same inner confidence as to his power to meet other
men and move them in the direction he desires that is to be
marked in a superior company commander</em>.</p>

<p>The natural leader is the real specialist of the armed services.
He is as prodigious, and as much a man apart, as the wizard
who has mastered supersonic speeds. Here we speak not alone
of the ability of an officer fully to control and develop his element
under training conditions, but to take the same element
into battle and conserve the total of its powers with complete
efficiency. The man who resolves to develop within himself the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
prerequisite qualities which serve such an object is moved by
the worthiest of all ambitions, for he has submitted himself to
the most complex task within human reach.</p>

<p>The self-assurance that one has promise in the field of command
is in part a derivative of growth and in part a matter of
instinct. But to the normal young officer, it comes as something
of a delightful surprise to learn that when he speaks other men
will listen, when he reasons they will become convinced, and
when he gives an order his authority is accepted. Far from
being a bad quality, this ingenuousness is wholesome because it
reflects warm appreciation of what has been given him. It does
not lessen confidence if a commander feels this way about those
who are within his charge throughout his service. The best results
flow when the working loyalty of other men is accepted
like manna from heaven, with gratitude rather than with gratification.
<em>Simply to feel that it is one's rightful portion is the
best proof that it is not, and leads to cockiness, windiness, and
self-adulation, with attendant loss of the sympathy of other men.</em>
The consequence to the individual whose dream of success is
only that he will take on more and more authority is that he will
suffer from a more and more one-sided development. The great
philosopher, Albert Schweitzer, holds up to other self-reliant
men the example of Defoe's hero, Robinson Crusoe, because he
is continually reflecting on the subject of human conduct and
he feels himself so responsible for this duty that when he gets
in a fight he thinks about how he can win it with the smallest
loss of human life. <em>The conservation of men's powers, not the
spending thereof, is the object of main concern to the truly
qualified military commander.</em></p>

<p>At the same time, there should be no mistake about the
manner in which command is exercised. To command is not
simply to compel or to convince but a subtle mixture of both.
Moral suasion and material compulsion are linked in its every
act. <em>It involves not only saying that this is the best thing to do
but inferring that the thing had best be done.</em> Force and reason
are inseparably linked in its nature, and the force of reason is
not more important than the reason of force, if the matter is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
be brought to a successful issue. <em>The very touchstone of loyalty
is that just demands will be put upon it.</em> It cannot endure and
strengthen except through finding material means of expression.
When men are given absolute freedom, with no compulsion upon
them but to eat and sleep, as with a group of South Sea savages,
there can be no strong, uniting bond between them. As for absolute
security, outside of the walls of a penitentiary it is virtually
nonexistent, though one would scarcely look inside the walls expecting
to find loyalty. In brief, being an active force in the
lives of humankind, <em>loyalty is developed through the unifying
of action</em>. <em>The more decisive the action becomes, the greater becomes
the vitality of the bond.</em> Service men look back with an
esteem, amounting almost to the love that a son feels for his
father, toward the captains who led them well on the battlefield.
But the best skipper they ever had on a training detail gets
hardly more than a kind word.</p>

<p>It has already been said that the man with a preeminent
ability to organize and direct the action of the military group
has an outstanding and greatly prized talent. The assumption
that the holder of a commission in an armed service of the
United States is possessed of this quality to a degree goes with
the commission; lacking it, the warrant would have been withheld.
But all men vary in their capacities to respond confidently
to any particular situation. Some, no matter how hard they try,
lack the keen edge.</p>

<p>To the officer who discovers that he is especially suited, by
temperament and liking, to the leading of combat forces, it
comes, therefore, almost as a personal charge that he will let
nothing dissuade him from the conviction that his post of duty
is with the line. Though he may seek other temporary duty to
advance his own knowledge and interests, he should remain
mentally wedded to that which he does best, and which most
other men find difficult.</p>

<p>If it is a good rule for him, it applies just as well to all others
within his charge. This means close attention to the careers of
all junior leaders from the enlisted ranks, toward the end that
the fighting strength of the establishment will be conserved. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
personnel people will sometimes scuttle a fine natural leader of
a tactical platoon, simply because they have discovered that in
civilian life he ran a garage and there is a vacancy for a motor
pool operator, or switch a gunner who is zealous for his new
work back to a place in the rear, because the record book says
that he is an erstwhile, though reluctant, keeper of books.
From their point of view, this makes sense. But they are not
always aware of how difficult and essential it is to find men who
can lead at fighting. It is a point which all officers need ponder,
for in our modern enthusiasm over the marvels that can be
worked by a classification system, we tend to overlook that
fighting power is the main thing, and that the best hands are
not to be found behind every bush.</p>

<p>When war comes, there are vast changes in the tempo and
pressure of life within the armed establishment. Faced with
new and unmeasured responsibility, almost every man would
be depressed by the feeling that he is out far beyond his depth,
if he were not buoyed by the knowledge that every other man
is in like case, and that all things are relative. Once these points
are recognized, the experience becomes exalting. A relatively
junior officer finds himself able confidently to administer a policy
applying to an entire service; a bureau, which might have been
laboring to save money in the purchase of carpet tacks and
pins, becomes suddenly confronted with the task of spending
billions, and of getting action whatever the cost.</p>

<p>But despite the radical change in the scale of operations, the
lines laid down for the conduct of business remain the same.
The regulations under which the armed services proceed are
written for peace and war, and cover all contingencies in either
situation. The course of conduct which is set forth for an officer
under training conditions is the standard he is expected to follow
when war comes. Administration is carried out according to
the same rules, though it is probably true that there is less
"paper doll cutting"&mdash;meaning that the tide of paper work,
though larger in volume, is more to the point. To the young
officer, it must oftentime seem that, under peacetime training
conditions, he is being called on constantly to read reports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
which should never have been written in the first place and is
required to write memoranda which no one should be forced
to read in the second place. For that matter, the same thought
occurs not infrequently to many of his seniors. But there is this
main point in rebuttal&mdash;it is all a part of the practice and
conditioning for a game which is in deadly earnest when war
comes. If the armed services in peace were to limit correspondence
up and down the line to those things which were either
routine or altogether vital, few men would develop a facility
at staff procedures.</p>

<p>In one sense, the same generalization applies to the workings
of the security system. There is the common criticism that the
services always tend to over-classify papers, and make work for
themselves by their careful safeguarding of "secrets" in which
no one is interested. The idea is not without warrant; part of
the trouble stems from the fact that the line between what can
safely be made of public knowledge and what can not is impossible
of clear definition. Hence the only safe rule-of-thumb is,
"When in doubt, classify." There is, however, the other point
that it is only through officers learning how to safeguard security,
handle papers according to the regulations, and keep a
tightly buttoned lip on all things which are essentially the
business of the service during peacetime that they acquire the
disciplined habit of which matures not only their personal success
but the national safety when war comes.</p>

<p>Oftentimes the rules seem superfluous. A man scans a paper
and sees that the contents are innocuous, and ignoring the
stamp, he leaves the document on his desk, because he is too
lazy to unlock the file. <em>But the rules mean exactly what they
say, and because their purpose is of final importance to the
nation, they will be enforced.</em> There is no surer way for an
officer to blight an otherwise promising career than to become
careless about security matters. The superior who looks lightly
on such an offense is but seeking trouble for himself.</p>

<p>Even so, it is to be observed that regulations are a general
guide to conduct, and though they mean what they say they are
not utterly inflexible. One must not be like the half-wit de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>scribed
by Col. George F. Baltzell to his trainees during World
War I. Joe had attached himself to the Confederate command
of the Colonel's father, whose last chore before turning in was
to post the boy. One night in a Virginia Tidewater operation,
Joe was told to stay by a stump until morning. At dawn the unit
was moving out in a fog when the elder Baltzell bethought
himself of Joe. Down by the riverside his cries finally brought a
faint answer through the mist, "Here I is." "What are you doing
there, boy?" barked the officer, "I told you not to move." "I
hain't moved, sir," replied the invisible Joe, up to his neck in
water, "the river done riz." An occasional unforeseen circumstance
arises in which it is nonsensical, or even impossible, to
adhere to the letter of regulations, as of orders. It is then essential
that an officer use plain common sense, acting according to
the spirit of the regulation, so that it is clearly manifest he did
the best possible thing within the determining set of conditions.
For example, in the European Theater, the Historian had
charge of 32 tons of documents, all classified "Confidential,"
"Secret" or "Top Secret." There were not enough safes or
secured files in the whole of France to hold this material, which
meant that established procedures could not be followed. A
permanent guard and watch was put on the archive. Wooden
cases were made from scrap lumber. Ample fire-fighting equipment
was brought in. Personnel was drilled in evacuating the
material in its order of importance, should fire occur. The setup
was inspected twice daily by the commander or his executive.
Though these arrangements still fell short of the letter of regulations,
they perforce had to satisfy any inspector because there
was no sounder alternative.</p>

<p>When circumstances require any officer to take a course
which, while appearing in his view to be in the best interests of
the service, runs counter to the lines of action laid down by
constituted authority, he has the protection that he may always
ask for a court to pass judgment on what he had done. We are
all prone to associate the court martial process only with the
fact of punishment, but it is also a shield covering official integrity.
The privilege of appealing to the judgment and sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of fair play in a group of one's fellow officers is a very comforting
thing in any emergency situation, requiring a desperate decision,
and engaging conflicting interests. It gives one a feeling
of backing even when circumstances are such that one is making
a lonely decision. Almost needless to say, cases of this sort
are far more likely to occur in war than during peace.</p>

<p>Inspection takes on a somewhat different hue during war. It
becomes more frequent but, on the whole, less zealous with
respect to spit-and-polish and less captious about the many
little things which promote good order and appearance throughout
the general establishment. This condition is accentuated as
organizations move closer to the zone of fire. Higher authority
becomes more engrossed in the larger affairs of operation.
At all levels more and more time is taken in dealing with the
next level above, which means that less and less can be given
to looking at the structure down below.</p>

<p>What then is the key to over-all soundness in the services in
any hour of great national peril? This, that in all services, at
all times and at all levels, each officer is vigilant to see that his
own unit, section or office is inspection-proof by every test
which higher authority might apply.</p>

<p>It should not require the visit of an inspector to any installation
to apprise those who are in charge as to what is being
badly done.</p>

<p>The standards are neither complex nor arbitrary. They can
be easily learned. Thereafter, all that is needed are the eyes to
see and the will to insist firmly that correction be made.</p>

<p>In officership, there is simply no substitute for personal
reconnaissance, nor any other technique that in the long run
will have half its value. Gen. Carl A. Spaatz, the first leader of
our independent Air Force, was so renowned for this disciplined
habit of getting everywhere and seeing everything that,
even when he was a relatively young major, a story about his
ubiquitousness gained service-wide fame. An ailing recruit was
being examined by a doctor at March Field. "Do you see spots
before your eyes?" the doctor asked. "Heavens," groaned the
recruit. "Do I have to see him in here, too?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Once formed, the habit of getting down to the roots of organization,
of seeing with one's own eyes what is taking place,
of measuring it against one's own scale of values, of ordering
such changes as are needed, and of following-through to make
certain that the changes are made, becomes the mainspring of
all efficient command action.</p>

<p>In battle, there is no other way to be sure. In training, there
is no better way to move toward self-assurance.</p>

THE MISSION</h3>


<p>There is a main reason why the word "mission" has an
especial appropriateness to the military services and implies
something beyond the call of duty. The arms of the United
States do not advance simply through the process of correct
orders being given and then executed with promptness, vigor,
and intelligence.</p>

<p>That is the greater part of the task, but it is by no means all.
Military systems reflect the limitations and imperfections of
their human material. Whatever his station, and experience, no
man is wise enough and all-seeing enough that he can encompass
every factor in a given problem, take correct judgment on
every area of weakness, foresee all of that which has not yet
happened, and then write the perfect analysis and solution for
the guidance of his subordinates.</p>

<p>The perfecting of operations, and the elimination of grit
from the machinery, therefore become the concern of <em>all</em>, directing
their thought and purpose to the doing of whatever needs to
be done to further the harmony and efficiency of the establishment,
taking personal action where it is within their province,
or calling the matter to the attention of higher authority when
it is not. In this direct sense, every ensign and second lieutenant
has a personal responsibility for the general well-being of the
security structure of the United States. This is fact, and not
theory. In World War II, many of the practical ideas which
were made of universal application in the services were initiated
by men of very junior rank. But the extent to which any man's
influence may be felt beyond his immediate circle depends first
of all upon the thoroughness with which he executes his assigned
duties, since nothing else will give his superiors confidence in his
judgments. It is only when he is exacting in small things, and is
careful to "close the circuit" on every minor assignment, that he
qualifies himself to think and act constructively in larger mat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>ters,
through book study and imaginative observation of the
situation which surrounds him. At this stage, an officer is well
on the road to the accomplishment of his general mission.</p>

<p>When an order is given, what are the responsibilities of the
man who receives it? In sequence, these:</p>


<ul>
<li>To be certain that he understands what is required.</li>

<li>To examine and organize his resources as promptly as
possible.</li>

<li>Fully to inform his subordinates on these points.</li>

<li>To execute the order without waste of time or means.</li>

<li>To call for support if events prove that his means are inadequate.</li>

<li>To fill up the spaces in the orders if there are developments
which had not been anticipated.</li>

<li>When the detail is complete, to prepare to go on to something
else.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lt. Gen. Sir Frederick Morgan, who planned the invasion of
Normandy, put the matter this way: "When setting out on any
enterprise, it is as well to ask oneself three questions. To whom
is one responsible? For precisely what is one responsible? What
are the means at one's disposal for discharging this responsibility?"</p>

<p>Nothing so warms the heart of a superior as that, on giving an
order, he sees his subordinate salute, say "Yes sir," then about
face and proceed to carry it out to the hilt, without faltering or
looking back. This is the kind of man that a commander will
choose to have with him every time, and that he will recommend
first for advancement.</p>

<p>On the other hand, clarification of the object is not only a
right but a duty, and it cuts both ways. Orders are not always
clear, and no superior is on firm ground when he is impatient
of questions which are to the point, or resentful of the man who
asks them. But it is natural that he will be doubtful of the man
whose words show either that he hasn't heard or is concerned
mainly with irrelevencies. The cultivation of the habit of careful,
concentrated listening, and of collected thought in reading
into any problem, is a principal portal to successful officership.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>To say that promptness and positiveness in the execution of a
mission are at all times major virtues does not imply that the
good man, like an old fire horse, moves out instantly at the clang
of a bell. Soundness of action involves a sense of timing. Thoroughness
is the way of duty, rather than a speed which goes off
half-cocked. There is frequently a time for waiting; there is always
time for acute reflection. The brain which works "like a
steel trap" exists only in fiction. Even such men as General
Eisenhower, or Admiral Nimitz, or for that matter, Gen. U. S.
Grant, have at times deferred decision temporarily while waiting
for a change in tide or circumstance to help them make up
their minds. This is normal in the rational individual; it is not
a sign of weakness. Rather than to cultivate a belief in one's
own infallibility, the mature outlook for the military man is best
expressed in the injunction of the Apostle Paul: "<em>Let all things
be done decently and in order.</em>" Grant, wrote of the early stage
of his advance on Richmond: "At this time I was not entirely
decided as to how I should move my Army." From the pen of
General Eisenhower come these words: "The commander's success
will be measured more by his ability to lead than by his
adherence to fixed notions." Thus, in the conduct of operations
not less than in the execution of orders, it is necessary that the
mind remain plastic and impressionable.</p>

<p>Within military organization, to refuse an order is unthinkable,
though to muster a case showing why some other order
would serve in its place is not undutiful in an individual
subordinate, any more than in a staff. By the same rule, insistence
that an order be carried out undeviatingly, simply because
it has been given, does not of itself win respect for the
authority uttering it. Its modification, however, should never
be in consequence of untempered pressure from below. To
change or rescind is justified only when reestimate of all of the
available facts indicates that some other order will serve the
general purpose more efficiently.</p>

<p>Taking counsel of subordinates in any enterprise or situation
is therefore a matter of giving them full advantage of one's own
information and reasoning, weighing with the intellect whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
thought or argument they may contribute to the sum of considerations,
and then making, without compromise, a clean decision
as to the line of greatest advantage. To know how to
command obedience is a very different thing from making men
obey. Obedience is not the product of fear, but of understanding,
and understanding is based on knowledge.</p>

<p>On D-day in Normandy, Lt. Turner B. Turnbull undertook
to do with his platoon of 42 men a task which had been intended
for a battalion; he was to block the main road to enemy
forces pressing south from the Cherbourg area against the
American right flank. In early morning he engaged a counterattacking
enemy battalion, supported by mortars and a self-propelled
gun at the village of Neuville au Plain. The platoon
held its ground throughout the day. By dusk the enemy had
closed wide around both its flanks and was about to cut the
escape route. Turnbull had 23 men left. He said to the others,
"There's one thing left to do; we can charge them." Pfc. Joseph
Sebastian, who had just returned from reconnoitering to the
rear, said, "I think there's a chance we can still get out; that's
what we ought to do." Turnbull asked of his men, "What's
your judgment?" They supported Sebastian as having the
sounder idea. In a twinkling Turnbull made his decision. He
told the others to get set for the run; he was losing men even
while he talked; he ordered that the 12 wounded were to be
left behind. Corp. James Kelly, first aid man, said he would
stay with the wounded. Pfc Sebastian, who had argued Turnbull
into a withdrawal, volunteered to stand his ground and
cover the others with a BAR. Corp. Raymond Smitson said he
would stay by Sebastian and support him with hand grenades.
Sgt. Robert Niland started for one of the machine guns, to
help Smitson and Sebastian in covering the withdrawal, but was
shot dead by a German closing in with a machine pistol before
he could reach it. The 16 remaining survivors took off like so
many shots fired from a pistol, at full speed but at intervals, to
minimize the target. All got back to their Battalion, though
Turnbull was killed in action a few days later. Their 1-day
fight had preserved the flank of an Army. For economy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
effort, and power of decision, there is not a brighter example in
the whole book of war.</p>

<p>To encourage subordinates to present their views, and to
weigh them in the light of reason, is at the same time the surest
way to win their confidence and to refine one's own information
and judgments. However, to leave final decision to them in
matters which are clearly in the area of one's own responsibility,
is fatal to the character of self and to the integrity of the force.</p>

<p>Any officer is one among many. Behind the smallest unit is the
total power of the combined services. In the main, effectiveness
develops out of unity of effort. To commit one's force to desperate,
unhelped enterprises, when there is support at hand
which may be had for the asking, may be one road to glory,
but it is certainly not the path to success in War. The Charge of
the Light Brigade at Balaklava was made immortal by Tennyson's
poem, but it was as foolhardy as asking a troop of Boy
Scouts to capture Gibraltar. In battle, a main obligation of those
who lead is to make constant resurvey of the full horizon of their
resources and means of possible support. This entails in time of
peace the acquisition of a great body of knowledge seemingly
unrelated to the administration of one's immediate affairs. It
entails, also, facing forthrightly toward every task, or assignment,
giving it a full try, sweating out every obstacle, but not
being ashamed to ask for help or counsel if it proves to be
beyond one's powers. <em>To give it everything, though not quite
making the grade personally, is merely an exercise in character
building. But to have the mission fail because of false pride is
inexcusable.</em></p>

<p>The prayer that Sir Francis Drake wrote down for his men as
he led them forth to a great adventure might well be repeated
by any leader in the hour when he begins to despair because in
spite of his striving he has not gained all he sought: "O Lord
God, when Thou givest to thy servants to endeavour any great
matter, grant us also to know that it is not the beginning, but the
continuing of the same until it is thoroughly finished, which
yieldeth the true glory."</p>

<p>The courage to start will carry a man far. Under the condi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>tions
of either war or peace, it is astonishing how many times
all things come in balance for the man who is less fearful of
rebuff than of being counted a cypher. One of Britain's great
armored leaders, Lt. Gen. Sir Giffard Martel, digested the
lesson of his whole life experience into this sentence: "If you
take a chance, it usually succeeds, presupposing good judgment."
Finally, it comes to that, for the willingness to accept
calculated risks is of the essence of effective personal performance
within the military profession. There must be careful collection
of data. There must be weighty consideration of all
known and knowable factors in the given situation. But beyond
these things, what?</p>

<p>To convey the idea that an officer must by ingrained habit
dispose himself to take action only after he has arrived at an
exact formula, pointing exclusively in one direction, would mean
only that under the conditions of war he could never get off
his trousers-seat. For such fullness of information and confidence
of situation are not given to combat commanders once in
a lifetime.</p>

<p>It is customary to treat "estimate of situation" as if it were
pure mathematical process, pointing almost infallibly to a definite
result. But this is contrary to nature. The mind of man does
not work that way, nor is it consistent with operational realities.
Senior commanders are as prone as even the newest junior
lieutenant to labor in perplexity between two opposing courses
of action during times of crisis, and then make their decisions
almost with the abruptness of an explosion. <em>It is post-decision
steadiness more than pre-decision certitude which carries the
day.</em> A large part of decision is intuitive; it is the byproduct of
the subconscious. In war, much of what is most pertinent lies
behind a drawn curtain. The officer is therefore badly advised
who would believe that a hunch is without value, or that there
is something unmilitary about the simple decision to take some
positive action, even though he is working in the dark.</p>

<p>The youthful Col. Julian Ewell of the 501st Parachute Infantry
Regiment, reaching Bastogne, Belgium, on the night of
December 18, 1944, with only his lead battalion at hand, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>sisted
that he be given orders, even though higher headquarters
could tell him almost nothing about the friendly or enemy
situations. He got his orders, and with the one battalion moved
out through the dark to counter-attack. So doing, he stopped
cold the German XXXXVII Panzer Corps, and compelled
Hitler to alter his Ardennes plan.</p>

<p>To grasp the spirit of orders is not less important than to
accept them cheerfully and keep faith with the contract. But
the letter of an instruction does not relieve him who receives it
from the obligation to exercise common sense. In the Carolina
maneuvers of 1941, a soldier stood at a road intersection for 3
days and nights directing civilian traffic, simply because the man
who put him there had forgotten all about it. Though he was
praised at the time, he was hardly a shining example to hold
up to troops. Diligence and dullness are mutually exclusive
traits. The model who is well worth pondering by all services
is Chief Boatswain L. M. Jahnsen who on the morning of
Pearl Harbor was in command of the yard garbage scow YG-17.
She was collecting refuse from the fleet when the first Japanese
planes came over. As the West Virginia began to burn, Jahnsen
headed his scow into the heat and smoke and ordered his men
to man their single fire hose. The old assignment forgotten,
with overheated ammunition exploding all around him, he stood
there directing his men in all that could be done to lessen the
ruin of the fleet.</p>

<p>Within the services, a special glory attends those whose
heroism or service is "above and beyond the call of duty." But
they owe their fundamental character to the millions of men
who have followed the path of duty above and beyond the call
of orders.</p>

<p>Whatever the nature of an officer's assignment, there are compensations.
The conventional attitude is to speak disparagingly
of staff duty, sniff at service with a higher administrative headquarters
as if it were somehow lacking in true masculine appeal,
and express a preference for duty "at sea," "with troops" or
"in the field." Although most of this is flapdoodle, it probably
does no more harm than Admiral William F. Halsey's grimace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
over the fact that he once "commanded an LSD&mdash;Large Steel
Desk." He is a poor stick of a military man who has no natural
desire to try his hand at the direct management of men, if for
no better reason than to test his own mettle. Even the avowed
specialist is better equipped for his own groove if he has proved
himself at the other game.</p>

<p>Staff work, however, has its own peculiar rewards. Chief
among them are the broadening of perspective, a more intimate
contact with the views, working methods and personality characteristics
of higher commanders and the chance to become acquainted
with administrative responsibility from the viewpoint
of policy. Although it sounds mysterious and even forbidding,
until one has done it, the procedures are not more complex nor
less instructive than in any other type of assignment.</p>

<p>There are no inside secrets about what goes here that is different,
or will not work equally well elsewhere. The staff is simply
the servant of the general force; it exists but to further the
welfare of the fighting establishment. Those within it are remiss
if they fail to keep this rule uppermost. Consequently, no special
attitude is called for, other than an acute receptiveness. The
same military bearing, the same naturalness of manner which
enable an officer to win the confidence and working loyalty of
his men will serve just as well when he is dealing with higher
authority.</p>

DISCIPLINE</h3>


<p>Though many of the aspects of discipline can be discussed
more appropriately in other sections of this book, an officer
must understand its particular nature within American military
forces if he is to win from his men obedience coupled with
activity at will.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that the root meaning of a word more
nearly explains the whole context of ideas with which it is
legitimately associated than the public's mistaken use of the
same word. Coming from the Latin, "to discipline" means "to
teach." Insofar as the military establishment of the United
States is concerned, nothing need be added to that definition.
Its discipline is that standard of personal deportment, work
requirement, courtesy, appearance and ethical conduct which,
inculcated in men, will enable them singly or collectively to
perform their mission with an optimum efficiency.</p>

<p>Military discipline, in this respect, is no different than the
discipline of the university, a baseball league or a labor union.
It makes specific requirements of the individual; so do they. It
has a system of punishments; so do they. These things are but
incidental to the end result. Their main object is to preserve
the interests and further the opportunity of the cooperative
majority. But the essential difference between discipline in the
military establishment and in any other free institution is this,
that if the man objects, he still does not have the privilege of
quitting tomorrow, and if he resists or becomes indifferent and
is not corrected, his bad example will be felt to the far end of
the line.</p>

<p>Though the failure to stop looting by our forces during
World War II, and the redeployment riots which followed it,
are both unpleasant memories, they underscored a lesson already
affirmed by every American experience at arms. The most
contagious of all moral diseases is insubordination, and it has no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
more respect for rank than the plague. When higher authority
winks at its existence among the rank and file, it will contaminate
upward as well as down. Once a man condones remissness,
his own belief in discipline begins to wither. The
officer who tolerates slackness in the dress of his men soon
ceases to tend his own appearance, and if he is not called to
account, his sloppy habits will shortly begin to infect his
superior. There is only one correct way to wear the uniform.
When any deviations in dress are condoned within the services,
the way is open to the destruction of all uniformity and unity.
This continuing problem of stimulating all ranks to toe-up to
that straight line of bearing and deportment which will build
inner confidence and win public respect is the main reason why,
as George Washington put it: "To bring men to a proper degree
of subordination is not the work of a day, a month, or a year."
It calls not simply for a high-minded attitude toward the profession
of arms but for infinitely patient attention to a great
variety of detail. An officer has a disciplined hold upon his own
job only when, like the air pilot preparing to take off, he
makes personal check of every point where the machinery might
fail. The stronger his example of diligence, the more earnestly
will it be followed by the ablest of his subordinates, and they
in turn will carry other men along. No leader ever fails his men&mdash;nor
will they fail him&mdash;who leads them in respect for the
disciplined life. Between these two things&mdash;discipline in itself
and a personal faith in the military value of discipline&mdash;lies
all the difference between military maturity and mediocrity. A
salute from an unwilling man is as meaningless as the moving
of a leaf on a tree; it is a sign only that the subject has been
caught by a gust of wind. But a salute from the man who takes
pride in the gesture because he feels privileged to wear the
uniform of the United States, having found the service good, is
the epitome of military virtue. Of those units which were most
effective, and were capable of the greatest measure of self-help
during World War II combat, it was invariably remarked
that they observed the salute and the other rules of courtesy
better than the others, even when engaged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>The level of discipline is in large part what the officers in any
unit choose to make it. The general aim of regulations is to
set an over-all standard of conduct and work requirement for all
concerned. Training schedules, operational directives and other
work programs serve the same end. <em>But there is still a broad
area in which the influence of every officer is brought to bear.
To state what is required is only the beginning; to require
what has been stated is the positive end.</em> The rule of courtesy
may be laid down by the book; it remains for the officer to rule
by work rather than working by rules, and by setting the good
example for his men, stimulate their acceptance of orderly military
habits. A training schedule may stipulate that certain tasks
be carried out but only the officer in charge can assure that the
work will be accomplished with fidelity.</p>

<p>The level of discipline should at all times be according to
what is needed to get the best results from the majority of dutiful
individuals. There is no practical reason for any sterner
requirement than that. There is no moral justification for countenancing
anything less. <em>Discipline destroys the spirit and
working loyalty of the general force when it is pitched to the
minority of malcontented, undutiful men within the organization,
whether to punish or to appease them.</em> When this common
sense precept is ignored, the results invariably are unhappy.</p>

<p>However, it is not here inferred that what has to be done to
build strong discipline in forces will at all times be welcomed
by the first-class men within a unit, or that their reaction will
always be approval. Rather, it is to say that they will accept
what is ordered, even though they may gripe about it, and that
ultimately their own reason will convince them of the value of
what is being done.</p>

<p>Until men are severely tried, there is no conclusive test of
their discipline, nor proof that their training at arms is satisfying
a legitimate military end. The old game of follow-the-leader
has no point if the leader himself, like the little girl in a
Thomas Hardy novel, is balked by insuperable obstacles one-quarter
inch high. <em>All military forces remain relatively undisciplined
until physically toughened and mentally conditioned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
unusual exertion.</em> Consider the road march! No body of men
could possibly enjoy the dust, the heat, the blistered foot and the
aching back. But hard road marching is necessary if a sound
foundation is to be built under the discipline of fighting forces,
particularly those whose labors are in the field. And the gain
comes quickly. The rise in spirits within any organization
which is always to be observed after they rebound from a hard
march does not come essentially from the feeling of relief
that the strain is past, but rather from satisfaction that a goal
has been crossed. <em>Every normal man needs to have some sense
of a contest, some feeling of resistance overcome, before he can
make the best use of his faculties. Whatever experience serves
to give him confidence that he can compete with other men
helps to increase his solidarity with other men.</em></p>

<p>It must be accepted that discipline does not break down
under the strain of placing a testing demand upon the individual.
It is sloth and not activity that destroys discipline.
Troops can endure hard going when it serves an understandable
end. This is what they will boast about mainly when the
fatigue is ended. A large part of training is necessarily directed
toward conditioning them for unusual hardship and privation.
They can take this in stride. But no power on earth can reconcile
them to what common sense tells them is unnecessary hardship
which might have been avoided by greater intelligence in
their superiors. When they are overloaded, they know it. When
they are required to form for a parade two hours ahead of
time because their commander got over-anxious, or didn't know
how to write an order, again they know it! <em>And they are perfectly
right if they go sour because this kind of thing happens
a little too often within the command.</em></p>

<p>Within our system, that discipline is nearest perfect which
assures to the individual the greatest freedom of thought and
action while at all times promoting his feeling of responsibility
toward the group. <em>These twin ends are convergent and
interdependent for the exact converse of the reason that it is
impossible for any man to feel happy and successful if he is in
the middle of a failing institution.</em> War, and all training oper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>ations
in preparation for it, have become more than ever a
problem of creating diversity of action out of unity of thought.
Its modern technological aspects not only require a much keener
intelligence in the average file but a higher degree of initiative
and courageous confidence in his own judgments. If the man is
cramped by monotonous routine, or made to feel that he cannot
move unless an order is barked, he cannot develop these
qualities, and he will never come forward as a junior leader.
<em>On the other hand, the increased utilization of the machine in
military operations, far from lessening the need of mutual support
and unified action, has increased it.</em> One of the hazards of
high velocity warfare is that reverse and disaster can occur
much more swiftly than under former systems. Thus the need
for greater spiritual integration within forces, and increased
emphasis upon the values of more perfect communication in all
forms, at the same time that each individual is trained to
initiate action for the common good. Only so can the new
discipline promote a higher efficiency based on a more steadfast
loyalty of man to man. In the words of Du Picq, who saw so
deeply into the hearts of fighting men: "If one does not wish
bonds broken, one should make them elastic and thereby
strengthen them."</p>

<p>The separate nature of military service is the key to the
character of the discipline of its several forces. In the United
States, we have fallen into the sloppy habit of saying that a
soldier, bluejacket, airman, coast guardsman or marine is only
an American civilian in uniform. The corollary of this quaint
notion is that all military organization is best run according to
the principles of business management. The truth of either of
these ideas is to be disputed on two grounds: both are contrary
to truth and contrary to human nature. An officer is not only
an administrator but a magistrate, and it is this dual role which
makes his function so radically different than anything encountered
in civil life&mdash;to say nothing of the singleness of purpose
by which the service moves forward. Moreover, the armed service
officer deals with the most plastic human material within
the society&mdash;men who, in the majority, the moment they step<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
into uniform, are ready to seek his guidance toward a new
way of life.</p>

<p>However, these fancies are but tangential aspects of a much
larger illusion&mdash;that the Armed Services of the United States,
since they serve a democracy, can better perfect themselves
according to the measure that they become more and more
democratic. Authority is questioned in democratic countries
today, not only in government, but in industry, the school,
the church and the home. But to the extent that military
men lose their faith in its virtue and become amenable to
ill-considered reforms simply to appease the public, they relinquish
the power to protect and nurture that growth of free
men, free thought and free institutions which began among a
handful of soldiers in Cromwell's Army and was carried by
them after the Restoration to the North American mainland.
The relation of the military establishment to American democracy
is as a shield covering the body. But no wit of man can
make it a wholly "democratic" institution as to its own processes
without vitiating its strength, since it progresses through the
exercise of unquestioned authority at various levels.</p>

<p>One of these levels is the plane on which an ensign or second
lieutenant conducts his daily dealings with his men. George
Washington left behind these words, which are as good today
as when he uttered them from his command post: "Whilst men
treat an officer as an equal, regard him no more than a broomstick,
being mixed together as one common herd, no order nor
discipline can prevail." Out of his experience in the handling
of deck divisions during World War II, Edmund A. Gibson,
Boatswain's Mate, First Class, also said something which, put
alongside Washington's words, brings the whole subject of
officer-man relationships into clear focus: "Speaking for Navy
men, I am certain that they are entirely without any feeling of
inferiority, social or otherwise, to their officers. If superiority
or inferiority of any kind enters into their contemplation at all,
it is in the shape of a conviction, doubtless a wrong one, that
every serviceman, as a professional warrior, is above the narrow
interests which obsess the civilian."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Those who have served both as officer and under-officer well
understand the appropriateness of these two ideas, each to the
other, that the superior position of the officer must be preserved
for the good of the service, but that this engages recognition
of the individual equality of the enlisted man. They know, if
they have observed well and truly during their service in the
ranks, that the highest type enlisted man wants his officer to act
the part, maintain dignity and support the ideals which are
consonant with the authority vested in him by the Nation. But
this same man at the same time expects his officers to concede
him his right to a separate position and to respect his privacy.
It is a pitiable eminence that is not well founded upon sure
feeling for the value of its own prestige and the importance
of this factor at all levels.</p>

<p>In the military service of the United States, there is always
room for firm and forthright friendship between officer and
man. There is room for a close, uniting comradeship. There is
room for frank intellectual discussion and the exchange of
warm humor; no man goes far if he is all salt and no savor.
There is room for that kind of intimacy which enables each to
see the other as a human being, know something of the other's
emotions and help clear the atmosphere for honest counsel on
personal and organizational problems.</p>

<p>But there is no room for familiarity, since as in any other
sphere, it breeds contempt. When it occurs, respect flies out the
window, the officer loses part of his command authority and
discipline breaks down. Familiarity cannot obtain between the
superior and the subordinate without the vice of favoritism
entering into the conduct of organizational matters, even though
the former is guilty only of an over-zealous goodwill and the
latter is otherwise sensible to the interests of the unit. The
chief damage comes from the effect upon all others. It is when
all the bars are let down that men communicate those inner
failings which a greater reserve would keep under cover. Familiarity
toward a superior is a positive danger; toward a subordinate,
it is unbecoming and does not increase his trust. In excess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
it can have no other effect than a breach of confidence on
both sides.</p>

<p>Changes in the environmental situation do not alter the
natural proprieties of this relationship between any two men, the
one having higher authority and the other having the obligation
of obedience. Under the conditions of modern war, the
two not infrequently may be required to work together as a unit,
almost apart from the influence of organizational discipline.
Hardship and necessity may compel them to extend the limit of
personal accommodation to each other. They may go into battle
together. They may sleep in the same bed or foxhole. They
may drink from a common bottle and draw upon each other
for the means to keep going. But in adapting one's course according
to the rigors of any unconventional situation, authority
is maintained only through the exercise of a higher sense of
responsibility. However, the rule is applied according to the
circumstance, the rule itself remains inflexible.</p>

<p>Officers and men working together as a compact team, in any
type of military operation where success, and coordinated action
in the face of danger, depend mainly upon the moral resources
within one small group, develop a closer camaraderie and become
less formal than is normal elsewhere throughout the
services. The close confinement in which tank forces, airplane
crews and submarine crews must operate would stifle morale
and torture nerves otherwise. Whatever the patience of men
under such conditions, sooner or later they get on each other's
nerves. Therefore that system of relationships is best which is
least artificial and most relaxing to the spirit of the natural
man. But to construe this as a deviation from the standards of
discipline is to mistake the shadow for the substance.</p>

MORALE</h3>


<p>To grow in knowledge of how to win a loyal and willing
response from military forces, there must first be understanding
of the springs of human action, what they are, and how they
may be directed toward constructive ends. This done, the course
which makes for the perfecting of forces during peacetime
training need only be extended to harden them for the risk and
stress of war.</p>

<p>The mainspring is morale. The meaning of the word is
already known in a general way to every man who has qualified
for officership, so it is hardly necessary to redefine it. A World
War II bluejacket said it this way: "Morale is when your hands
and feet keep working when your head says it can't be done."
That says it just as well as anything written by du Picq or
Baron von Steuben. Nothing new need be added.</p>

<p>The handiest beginning is to consider morale in conjunction
with discipline, since in military service they are opposite sides
of the same coin. When one is present, the other will be also.
But the instilling of these things in military forces depends upon
leadership understanding the nature of the relationship.</p>

<p>As to discipline, until recent years, military forces tended to
stress the pattern rather than the ideal. The elder Moltke, one
of the great masters of the military art, taught his troops that it
was of supreme importance that they form accurately in training,
since the perfection of their formations would determine
their efficiency in battle. Yet in the Franco-Prussian War, these
formations proved utterly unsuited to the heavily wooded terrain
of the theater, and new ones had to be devised on the
spur of the moment.</p>

<p>This is the familiar story. It was repeated by United States
forces in World War II during the Normandy hedgerow fighting
and the invasions of the Central Pacific atolls. Troops had
to learn the hard way how to hit, and how to survive, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
moving through jungle or across the mountains and desert.
When that happened, the only disciplinary residue which mattered
was obedience to orders. The movements they had learned
by rote were of less value than the spiritual bond between one
man and another. The most valuable lesson was that of mutual
support. And unless this lesson was supported by confidence in
the judgment of those in authority, it is to be doubted that
they were helped at all.</p>

<p>Finally, that confidence is the <em>sine qua non</em> of all useful
military power. The moral strength of an organic unity comes
from the faith in ranks that they are being wisely directed and
from faith up top that orders will be obeyed. When forces are
tempered by this spirit, there is no limit to their enterprise.
They become invincible. Lacking it, however, any military body,
even though it has been compelled to toe the mark in training,
will deteriorate into a rabble under conditions of extraordinary
stress in the field, as McDowell's Army did at Bull Run in the
American Civil War, and as Hitler's Armies did in 1945 after
the Rhine had been crossed at Remagen.</p>

<p>In its essentials, discipline is not measured according to how
a man keeps step in a drill yard, or whether he salutes at just
the right angle. The test is how well and willingly he responds
to his superiors in all <em>vital</em> matters, and finally, whether he
stands or runs when his life is at stake. History makes this
clear. There are countless examples of successful military forces
which had almost no discipline when measured by the usual
yardsticks, yet had a high battle morale productive of the kind
of discipline which beats the enemy in battle. The French at
Valmy, the Boers in the South African War, and even the
men of Capt. John Parker, responding to his order on the
Lexington Common, "Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they
mean to have a war, let it begin here," instance that men who
lack training and have not been regimented still may express
themselves as a cohesive force on the field of fire, provided
that they are well led.</p>

<p>If we will accept the basic premise that discipline, even within
the military establishment of the United States, is not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
ritual or a form, but is simply that course of conduct which is
most likely to lead to the efficient performance of an assigned
responsibility, it will be seen that morale does not come of discipline,
but discipline of morale.</p>

<p>True enough, our recruits are given a discipline almost from
the moment that they take the oath. Their first lesson is the
necessity for obedience. They are required immediately to conform
to a new pattern of conduct. They respond to disciplinary
treatment even before they learn to think as a group and before
the attitude of the group has any influence upon them. Discipline
bears down before morale can lift up. Momentarily, they
become timid before they have felt any pain. These first reactions
help condition the man to his new environment. They are
in part demoralizing, but on the upswing he begins to realize
that half the fun in life comes of seeing what one can do in a
new situation. The foundation of his morale is laid when he
begins to think of himself as a member of the fighting establishment,
rather than as a civilian. Thereafter all that is done
to nourish his military spirit and to arouse his thirst for professional
knowledge helps to build his moral power.</p>

<p>But follow the man a little longer. The time quickly comes
when he knows his way around in the service. His earlier fears
and hesitations are largely gone. He acquires strength and wisdom
from the group. He becomes able to judge his own situation
against an attainable standard within the service. He is
critically conscious of the merits of his superiors from what he
has himself experienced and what others tell him. He knows
what is boondoggling and what is not.</p>

<p>From that point on, discipline has little part in alerting the
man or in furthering the building of his moral power. That
which moves him mainly is the knowledge that he is a personal
success, and that he belongs to an efficient unit which is in
capable hands. Certain of the outer signs of discipline, such as
the cadence of the march or snap in the execution of the
manual, he may subconsciously reenforce his impression of these
things. But if he feels either that he is an outsider or that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
club isn't worth joining, no amount of spit and polish will alter
his opinion.</p>

<p>He is able to recognize a right and reasonable discipline as
such, even though it causes him personal inconvenience, because
he has acquired a sense of military values. But if it is
either unduly harsh or unnecessarily lax, he likewise knows it
and wears it as a hairshirt, to the undoing of his morale.
Though the man, like the group, can be hurt by being pushed
beyond sensible limits, his spirit will suffer even more sorely if
no real test is put upon his abilities and moral powers. The
greater his intelligence, the stronger will be his resentment.
That is a law of nature. The enlightened mind has always the
greatest measure of self-discipline but it also has a higher sense
of what constitutes justice, fairplay and a reasonable requirement
in the performance of duty. If denied these things, he
will come to hold his chief, his job, and himself in contempt.
The greater part of man's satisfactions comes of activity and
only a very small remnant comes of passive enjoyment. Forgetting
this rather obvious fact in human nature, social reformers
aim at securing more leisure, rather than at making work
itself more satisfactory. But it need not be forgotten in the
military service.</p>

<p>Even to those who best understand the reasons for the regimenting
of military forces, a discipline wrongfully applied is
seen only as indiscipline. Invariably it will be countered in its
own terms. No average rank-and-file will become insubordinate
as quickly, or react as violently, as a group of senior noncommissioned
officers, brought together in a body, and then
mishandled by officers who are ignorant of the customs of the
service and the limits of their own authority. Not only are they
conscious of their rights, but they have greater respect for the
state of decency and order which is the mark of a proper military
establishment than for the insignia of rank. It is this firm
feeling of the fitness of things, and his unbounded allegiance
to an authority when it is based on character which makes the
NCO and the petty officer the backbone of discipline within
the United States fighting establishment. Sergeant Evans of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
"Command Decision" was an archtype of the best ball carriers
among them. In a sense, they remain independent workmen,
rather than a tool of authority, until the hour comes when they
fall in completely with someone their own nature tells them is
good. In the past, we have not always made the wisest use of
this latent strength. The normal desire of the veteran who has
won his stripes by hard service is to support his officers and
reduce the friction down below. Whatever is done to lessen his
dignity and prestige damages morale and creates new stresses in
the relations between the officer corps and the ranks. When he
is rebuffed, either because those above him are indifferent to
his pride or are unaware that he is their chief advocate among
the men, the military machinery loses its cushion and becomes
subject to increasing shock. Said a newly arrived lieutenant to
an old sergeant of the 12th Cavalry: "You've been here a long
time, haven't you?" "Yes sir," replied the sergeant. "The troop
commanders, they come and they go, but it don't hurt the
troop."</p>

<p>To comment on these things, however, is to emphasize once
again the supreme importance of the judgment of the officer in
dealing with all of his military associates in such way that he
will support that native pride, without which a man cannot
remain whole, and at the same time direct it toward the betterment
of the organization. To lecture troops about the importance
of morale and discipline serves no earthly purpose,
if the words are at odds with the general conditions which have
been imposed on the command. They impose their values only
as reflection of the leader's entire thought concerning his men.
At the same time, there is this to be remembered, that even
when things are going wrong at every other level, men will
remain loyal and dutiful if they see in the one junior officer who
is nearest them the embodiment of the ideals which they believe
should apply throughout the service. That is the main object
lesson in that remarkable novel written around a World War II
Navy auxiliary, "Mister Roberts." But it holds just as true in
our ground and air forces as for those afloat.</p>

<p>Morale comes of the mind and of the spirit. The question is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
how it is to be developed. Admiral Ben Moreell has stated a
formula in understanding terms by his explanation of what
made the Seabees notable for competence and devotion to duty
during World War II. This is what he said: "We used artisans
to do the work for which they had been trained in civil life.
They were well led by officers who 'spoke their language.'
We made them feel that they were playing an important
part in the great adventure. And thus they achieved a high
standard of morale." The elements underscored by Admiral
Moreell deserve special note.</p>


<ul>
<li>Satisfaction in a work program.</li>

<li>Mutual confidence between leaders and ranks.</li>

<li>Conviction that all together were striving for something
more important than themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>True, that was wartime, and the challenge was apparent to
all concerned. But the principles hold good under any and all
conditions, and can be applied to any organization by the officer
who approaches his task with enthusiasm and imagination.
The mission of keeping the world at peace, through a moral
strengthening of the security structure of the United States, is a
more difficult objective than that which confronted fighting
forces after Pearl Harbor. In his book, "World War: Its Cause
and Cure," Lionel Curtis stated our problem in its broadest
and most challenging terms: "Civilization began with a war
between freedom and despotism: we are now fighting its latest
campaign, and our task is to make it the last."</p>

<p>Under training conditions or in combat, the mental ills and
the resulting moral and physical deterioration which sometimes
beset military forces cannot be cured simply by the intensification
of disciplinary methods. It is true that the signs of a recovery
will sometimes attend the installation of a more rigid,
or less rigid, discipline. This onset is in fact usually due to the
collateral influence of an increased confidence in the command,
whereby men are made to feel that their own fortunes are on
the mend. Then discipline and morale are together revitalized
almost as if by the throwing of an electric switch.</p>

<p>In Army history, there is no better example of the working of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
this principle than the work of Brig. Gen. Paul B. Malone of
St. Aignan-sur-Cher, France, in 1919. He took over a command
where slackness and indiscipline were general. The men were
suffering terrible privation and too many of their officers were
indifferent to their needs. Many of the men had been battle
casualties. Some had been discharged from hospitals before their
wounds were healed. The mess was abominable. The camp was
short of firewood and other supply. In freezing weather, men
were sleeping on the ground with only a pair of blankets
apiece. The death toll from influenza, pneumonia, and the aggravation
of battle wounds rose daily. Despair and resentment
over these conditions began to express itself in semiviolent
form. Every fresh breach of discipline was countered with harassing
punishments until an air of wretched stagnation hung
over the whole camp. General Pershing visited the base. The
men refused to form for him. When he tried to address them
at a mass meeting, they wouldn't hear him out. Instead of taking
any action against the men, he sent for General Malone.</p>

<p>The new commander arrived without any instructions except
to determine what was wrong and correct it. With soldierly instinct,
he recognized that the indiscipline of the camp was an
effect and not a cause. But even as he gave orders for relieving
the physical distress of the men, he demanded that they return
to orderly habits.</p>

<p>He walked around the areas. Already, on his order, duck-boards
were being laid through the mud, and the whole physical
setup was in process of reorganization. The men, grown
listless from weeks of mistreatment, paid no heed. "Get on
your feet! I'm your general. I respect you but I want your
respect," were his words. They restored the situation. The first
impact of this one man on that camp was never forgotten by
anyone who saw it. It is a point to remember: <em>A firm hold at
the beginning pays tenfold the dividend of a timid approach,
followed by a show of firmness later on.</em> Within 48 hours the
physical condition of the camp was showing improvement and
60,000 men were again doing their duty and bearing themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in a military manner. The lessons from this one incident stand
out like beams from a searchlight battery.</p>

<p><em>One man is able to accomplish a miracle by an act of will
accompanied by good works.</em></p>

<p><em>The morale of the force flows from the self-discipline of the
commander, and in turn, the discipline of the force is reestablished
by the upsurge of its moral power.</em></p>

<p><em>The inculcation of military habits and thoughts is the only
means by which these forces may be made to work together
toward more perfect ends, so that control can be exercised
promptly.</em></p>

<p>When the redeployment period which followed World War II
threatened a complete collapse to the morale of the general
military establishment, the remedy attempted by some unit leaders
was to relax discipline and the work requirement all around.
Other officers met this crisis by improving the conditions of
work, setting an example which proved to the men that they
believed in its importance and paying sedulous attention to the
personal problems of those within the unit. They found that
they could still get superior performance in the midst of chaos.
Organic strength materializes in the same way on the field of
war. <em>However adverse the general situation, men will stick to
the one man who knows what he wants to do and welcomes
them to a full share in the enterprise.</em></p>

<p>The rule applies in matters great and small. No man who
leads a squad or a squadron, a group of men or a group of
armies, can develop within his force a well-placed confidence
in its own powers, if he is uncertain of himself or doubtful of his
object. The moral level of his men is mainly according to the
manner in which he expresses his personal force working with,
and for, them. If he is timid or aloof, uncommunicative and
unenthusiastic, prone to stand on his dignity and devoid of
interest in the human stuff of those who are within his charge,
they will not respond to him, and he will have raised a main
barrier to his own success. If, given a course or taking one of
his own choice, he worries so greatly about the obstacles in his
way that he cannot make penetrating search for the clear chan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>nel,
he will waste the powers of his men even though he may
have won their sympathy.</p>

<p>It would be futile to make these comments on the nature of
moral leading if it were not fully within the power of the
average young officer to cut his cloth according to the suggested
pattern. The commonplace that human nature cannot
be changed is untrue. The characters of each of us, and of
all of our acquaintances, are greatly affected by circumstances.
No man's impulses are fixed from the beginning by his native
disposition; they remain plastic until the hour of his death, and
whatever touches his circumference, influences them for better
or worse. <em>The power of decision develops only out of practice.
There is nothing mystic about it. It comes of a clear-eyed willingness
to accept life's risks, recognizing that only the enfeebled
are comforted by thoughts of an existence devoid of struggle.</em></p>

<p>Nothing more radical is being suggested here than that the
officer who would make certain that the morale of his men will
prove equal to every change cannot do better than concentrate
his best efforts upon his primary military obligation&mdash;his duty
to them. They dupe only themselves who believe that there is a
brand of military efficiency which consists in moving smartly,
expediting papers and achieving perfection in formations, while
at the same time slighting or ignoring the human nature of
those whom they command. The art of leadership, the art of
command, whether the forces be large or small, is the art of
dealing with humanity. Only the officer who dedicates his
thought and energy to his men can convert into coherent military
force their desire to be of service to the country. Such
were the fundamental values which Napoleon had in mind
when he said that those who would learn the art of war should
study the Great Captains. He was not speaking of tactics and
strategy. He was pointing to the success of Alexander, Caesar,
and Hannibal in moulding raw human nature, and to their
understanding of the thinking of their men and of how to direct
it toward military advantage. These are the grand objects.</p>

<p>Diligence in the care of men, administration of all organizational
affairs according to a standard of resolute justice, mili<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>tary
bearing in one's self, and finally, an understanding of the
simple facts that men in a fighting establishment wish to think
of themselves in that light and that all military information is
nourishing to their spirits and their lives, are the four fundamentals
by which the commander builds an all-sufficing morale
in those within his charge.</p>

<p>There are other motor forces and mechanisms, most of which
come under the heading of management principles, and are
therefore discussed in other portions of this volume. The exception
is the greatest force of all&mdash;patriotism. It may be
deemed beyond argument that belief in the social order and
political doctrine of their country is the foundation of a loyal,
willing spirit in military forces. Yet this alone cannot assure
efficiency in training or a battle <em>elan</em> which is the result of
proper training methods. There is nothing more soulless than a
religion without good works unless it be a patriotism which
does not concern itself with the welfare and dignity of the individual.
This is a simple idea though wise men in all ages have
recognized it as one of the most profound truths. From Aristotle
on down the philosophers have said that the main force in
shaping the characters of men is not teaching and preaching,
though these too are important, but the social framework in
which a man lives. In an age when there is widespread presumption
that practical problems can be solved by phrases, the
military body needs more than ever to hold steadfastly to first
principles. It does no good for an officer to talk patriotism to
his men unless he stands four-square with them, and they see in
him a symbol of what is right with the country. Under those
circumstances, he can always talk to them about the cause, and
what he says will be a tonic to morale.</p>

<p>In the Normandy invasion, a young commander of paratroops,
Lt. Col. Edward C. Krause, was given the task of capturing
a main enemy communications center. Three hours before the
take-off he assembled his Battalion, held a small American flag
in front of them and said these words; "This is the first flag
raised over the city of Naples. You put it there. I want it to be
the first flag raised over a liberated town in France. The mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>sion
is that we will put it up in Ste. Mere Eglise before dawn.
You have only one order&mdash;to come and fight with me wherever
you land. When you get to Ste. Mere Eglise, I will be
there."</p>

<p>The assignment was kept. Next morning, Krause and his
men raised the flag together, even before they had completed
capture of the town. As Americans go, they were extremely
rugged individualists. But they were proud of every line of that
story.</p>

ESPRIT</h3>


<p>To proceed toward a better understanding of <em>esprit</em> and its
part in the building of military forces, it is necessary to look
beyond the organization and consider the man.</p>

<p>The life of any socially upright individual is organized
around only a few basic loyalties and the degree of satisfaction
which he derives from existence can usually be measured
in terms of his service to them. He is loyal first to himself, for
failing that, he fails in loyalty to all else. If he cannot acquit
himself ably for his own sake, he cannot do honor to anything
less personal. Along with loyalty to self come loyalty to our
beliefs, loyalty to family, loyalty to country, loyalty to friends,
and loyalty to humanity in general.</p>

<p>Stated as a factual and not as an ideal matter, the interesting
and important thing that happens to a man when he enters
military service is that, the moment he takes the oath, loyalty to
the arms he bears ranks first on the list, above all other loyalties.
To get ahead, to serve himself well, he must persevere in
ways that are most useful to the organization. If the circumstances
of his family are reduced because of this new loyalty,
his means of compensating them is to strive for such honor as
may come to him through service to the United States. In his
life, service to country is no longer a beautiful abstraction; it
is the sternly concrete and unremitting obligation of service to
the regiment, the group or the ship's company. He parts with
old friends and finds new ones.</p>

<p>In this radical reorientation of the individual life and the
arbitrary imposition of a commanding loyalty is to be found
the key to the esprit of any military organization. Too long
esprit has been regarded as something bequeathed to the unit
by the dead hand of tradition. There is nothing moribund
about it. It is a dynamic and vital substance conducted to the
living by the living. We can banish from our minds the idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
that esprit is what the regiment, the ship or the company gives
the man because of some spark which its past deeds and the
legends thereof have lighted in him. Esprit, at all times, is what
the unit gives the man, in terms of spiritual force translated
into constructive good. Considering what the unit has taken
from him initially, its obligation is great indeed.</p>

<p>To see this clearly, we need to look once again at what
happens to the individual when he puts on the uniform. The
basis of his life changes in broad and fundamental ways. His
legal status is changed; the extent and intensity of his obligations
are magnified. He puts aside the banner of individualism
for that of obedience. Yet in the words of Chester Barnard:
"Scarcely a man, I think, who has felt the annihilation of his
personality in some organized system, has not also felt that the
same system belonged to him because of his own free will he
chose to make it so."</p>

<p>To that must be added the further thought that while the
military service is antecedent to the individual who enters it,
that individual is also in a sense antecedent to the service. He
becomes a factor in the equation which expresses the achievement
or the failure of the service in its particular mission. The
thoughtful commander will give careful regard to that relationship.
One man cannot make or break an Army or a Navy, but
he can help break it, since each service at all times derives its
nature from the quality and wills of its men. General Harbord,
in <em>The American Army in France</em>, expressed it this way: "Discipline
and morale influence the inarticulate vote that is constantly
taken by masses of men when the order comes to move
forward&mdash;a variant of the crowd psychology that inclines it to
follow a leader. But the Army does not move forward until the
motion has carried. 'Unanimous consent' only follows cooperation
between the individual men in ranks."</p>

<p>But we can go one step beyond General Harbord's suggestion
that the multiplied individual acceptance of a command alone
gives that command authority. It is not less true that the multiplied
rejection of a command nullifies it. In other words,
authority is the creature rather than the creator of discipline<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and obedience. In the more recent experiences of our arms,
under the stresses of battle, there are many instances of troops
being given orders, and refusing to obey. In every case, the
root cause was lack of confidence in the wisdom and ability of
those who led. When a determining number of men in ranks
have lost the will to obey, their erstwhile leader has <em>ipso facto</em>
lost the capacity to command. <em>In the final analysis, authority
is contingent upon respect far more truly than respect is founded
upon authority.</em> In the words of Col. G. F. R. Henderson:
"It is the leader who reckons with the human nature of his
troops, and of the enemy, rather than with their mere physical
attributes, numbers, armament and the like, who can hope to
follow in Napoleon's footsteps."</p>

<p><em>Esprit</em> then is the product of a thriving mutual confidence
between the leader and the led, founded on the faith that together
they possess a superior quality and capability. The failure
of the spirit of any military organization is less frequently due
to what men have forgotten than to what they can't forget.
No "imperishable record" of past greatness can make men serve
with any greater vigor if they are being served badly. Nor can
it sustain the fighting will of the organization so much as one
mil beyond the radius within which living associations enable
men to think great thoughts and act with nobility toward their
fellows. Unless the organization's past conveys to its officers a
sense of having been especially chosen, and unless they respond
to this trust by developing a complete sense of duty toward
their men, the old battle records might as well be poured down
the drain, since they will not rally a single man in the hour of
danger. Said Col. LeRoy P. Hunt in a mimeographed notice to
his troops just prior to the Guadalcanal landing: "We are
meeting a tough and wily opponent but he is not sufficiently
tough and wily to overcome us because We Are Marines."
(The capitals are Hunt's.)</p>

<p>Personality plays a part in the ability to command, both
under training conditions and under fire. But though a man
be a veritable John Paul Jones or Mad Anthony Wayne in the
time of action, his hardihood will never wholly undo any prior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
neglect of his men. While men may be rallied for a short
space by someone setting an example of great courage, they can
be kept in line under conditions of increasing stress and mounting
hardship only when loyalty is based upon a respect which
the commander has won by consistently thoughtful regard for
the welfare and rights of his men, and a correct measuring of
his responsibility to them.</p>

<p>There are a few governing principles, and before considering
their application in detail we should think first about the file.
He is a Man; he expects to be treated as an adult, not as a
schoolboy. He has rights; they must be made known to him and
thereafter respected. He has ambition; it must be stirred. He
has a belief in fair play; it must be honored. He has the need
of comradeship; it must be supplied. He has imagination; it
must be stimulated. He has a sense of personal dignity; it must
not be broken down. He has pride; it can be satisfied and made
the bedrock of his character once he gains assurance that he is
playing a useful and respected part in a superior and successful
organization. To give men working as a group the feeling of
great accomplishment together is the acme of inspired leadership.</p>

<p>In the degree that the disciplinary method and the training
procedure of the military service, and the common sense of his
superiors, combine to nourish these satisfactions in the individual,
<em>esprit de corps</em> comes into being and furthers his advance
in the practice of arms and his potential usefulness as a
fighting man. He becomes loyal because loyalty has been given
to him. He learns to serve an ideal because an ideal has served
him. For it is to be remembered that it is always the Army, the
Navy or the nation that disengages the man from his old moorings,
but it is the regiment or the ship's company which gives
him a fresh anchor and enables him to feel secure again. The
service cancels out the man's old life; the unit gives him a
fresh start in a new environment, which may prove salutary or
utterly damnable, as the man and the unit together make it.
Where there is enlightened leading, neither can fail the other.
<em>The majority of men, so long as they are treated fairly and feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
that good use is being made of their powers, will rejoice in a
new sense of unity with new companions even more than they
will mind the increased separation from their old associations.</em>
The ability to adjust is itself a landmark of success in the life
of a normal individual.</p>

<p>This is the primary gift of the organization to the man and
the primary advantage of its relationship to him. Once it has
given the file a sense of belonging, it restores his balance. It is
this feeling of possession which is the beginning of true esprit.
Without it, the man becomes a derelict. Indeed, we may go so
far as to say that the man who lacks it, and does not aspire
to it, will almost invariably be unsuited for combat or any military
responsibility of consequence, not because he is disrespectful
of tradition, but because he is a social outcast with no
sense of duty to his fellows.</p>

<p>Referring once again to the list of satisfactions due the man,
it will be noted that they differ little, if at all, from the demands
of his spirit before he has put on the uniform. But
there should be marked also the vital difference that whereas
a complex of social and economic forces and of totally disconnected
influences contribute to his outlook so long as he is a
civilian, the measure of his satisfactions is almost wholly in the
hands of the organization once he has raised his right hand and
taken the oath of military service to country. The condition of
his health, the amount of his pay, the organization of his leisure
time, his diet, his sleeping habits, his sex problems, even
the manner in which he shaves and wears his hair, are matters
of organizational concern. Within the new company, he may
either attain greatly, or miserably fail. It should speak to him
with the voice of Stentor, the bronze voice of 10,000 men&mdash;meaning
the thousand or so who are still with the ship, the
group or the regiment, and the thousands who are in the
shadows but who once served it well, thereby inspiring those
who follow to give an extra portion of service to their fellows.
Unless tradition has that effect upon the living, it will not
produce esprit, but military "mossbackism."</p>

<p>What does this imply in terms of practical application? Simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
that the custodianship of esprit must ever be in the hands of
the officer corps. When the heart of the organization is sound,
officership is able to see its own reflection in the eyes of the
enlisted man. For this simple reason: insofar as his ability to
mould the character of troops is concerned, the qualifying test
of the leader is the judgment placed upon his military abilities
by those who serve under him. If they do not deem him fit to
command, he cannot train them to obey. But if they see in one
man directly over them a steady example, the strongest of
their number will model after him, instead of sagging because of
weakness elsewhere in the command structure.</p>

<p>This point is irreducible. Though an officer have absolute
confidence in himself, and though he have an instinct amounting
to genius for the material things of war, these otherwise
considerable gifts will avail him little or nothing if his <em>manner</em>
is such that his troops remain unconvinced of his capacity and
doubtful of his power to maintain command in periods of extreme
trial. He will fail because he has not sufficiently regarded
the <span class="law_of_personality">LAW OF PERSONALITY&mdash;LOOKS, ACTIONS, WORDS</span>.</p>

<p>Among military men, there has been much mistaken praise
for the virtue of "mechanical obedience." There is no such
thing. Men think in their smallest actions; if this were not so,
it would not be possible to lead them. What has been blindly
termed "mechanical response" requires perhaps a higher concentration
of will than any other type of action, and hence
of thought itself, since the two are inseparable. The forces in
which this characteristic was outstanding have been those which
were led with the highest degree of intelligence and of understanding
of human nature. For unity of spirit and of action,
which is the essence of <em>esprit de corps</em>, is of all military miracles
the most difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Yet its abiding principle is simple. It comes of integrity and
clarification of purpose. The able officer is not a Saul waiting
for the light to strike him on the Damascus road, but a Paul
having a clear understanding that unless the trumpet give forth
a certain sound at all times, none shall prepare himself for the
battle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>Given such officers, the organization comes to possess a sense
of unity and of fraternity in its routine existence which expresses
itself as the force of cohesion in the hour when all
ranks are confronted by a common danger. It is not because of
mutual enthusiasm for an honored name but because of mutual
confidence in one another that the ranks of old regiments or
the bluejackets serving a ship with a great tradition are able to
convert their esprit into battle discipline. Under stress they
move and act together because they have imbibed the great
lesson, and experience has made its application almost instinctive,
that only in unity is there safety. They believe that they
can trust their comrades and commanders as they would trust
their next of kin. They have learned the necessity of mutual
support and a common danger serves but to bind the ranks
closer.</p>

<p>But the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the
strong. The newest unit&mdash;one born only yesterday&mdash;is as
susceptible to a vaulting esprit as any which traces its founding
to the beginnings of the Republic. Led by those who themselves
are capable of great endeavour, who are quick to encourage
and slow to disparage, and are ever ready to make due acknowledgment
of worthy effort and to let men know wherein
they are forging ahead, any military organization serving our
flag will come to count this among its strengths.</p>

<p>There are no tricks to the building of esprit. Its techniques
are those which come naturally in the course of stimulating the
interest of ranks in all of the great fundamentals of the military
profession, rather than selling short their intelligence, and
taking it for granted that they want nothing beyond the routine
of work, liberty, mess call, and payday.</p>

<p>But there is one pitfall. Toward the growth of esprit, the
attitude, "My organization first, and the rest nowhere," never
pays off. It begins with the idea, "<em>The service first, and my unit
the best in the service.</em>" In all human enterprise, the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts. The citizen who thinks most
deeply about his country will be the first to share the burdens
of his community and neighborhood. The man who feels the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
greatest affection for the service in which he bears arms will
work most loyally to make his own unit know a rightful pride
in its own worth. Among all of the military services from out
of the present and past, none has been more faithful to this
principle than the United States Marine Corps. Among its
members, being a Marine is the thing that counts mainly; after
that comes service to the Regiment or Battalion. Even the other
services marvel at the result. Though they take due pride in
their own virtues and accomplishments, they still regard the
esprit of the Marine with admiration, and more than a little
envy. What is the secret? Perhaps it is this, that the Corps
emphasizes the rugged outlet for men's energies, and never permits
its members to forget that the example of courage is their
most precious heritage.</p>

<p>Six years after his defeat at Wake Island, the things that
remained uppermost in the mind of Col. James P. S. Devereux,
as he put together the story of the most tragic hours of his life,
were the heroisms of the individuals who had been trained in
a tradition to which he had fully committed his own purpose.
One incident of that day, typical of many, is best related in
Devereux's own words.</p>

<p>"Master Sergeant J. Paszkiewicz, a Marine for 20 years, was
caught in the first blast at the airfield. Bombs shattered his
right leg. He started crawling off, dragging his smashed leg
limply behind him. The second wave of bombers came in.
Paszkiewicz reached a little pile of wreckage and found what he
wanted, a piece of wood. With a little fixing it could serve as
a crutch. The bombs were dropping again. Paszkiewicz started
hobbling off. He seemed to be going the wrong way. Somebody
tried to help him, but he wasn't having any. Lieutenant
David D. Kliewer saw him stumbling along on his makeshift
crutch, giving first aid to the wounded or trying to make a
dying man a little easier."</p>

<p>Could a man give that much, and could his superior, Devereux,
have remembered it so vividly from amid his own personal
trials, unless both had been inspired by the traditions of
the Corps?</p>

KNOWING YOUR JOB</h3>


<p>In one of his little-known passages, Robert Louis Stevenson
did the perfect portrait of the man who finally failed at everything,
because he just never learned how to take hold of his
work.</p>

<p>It goes like this: "His career was one of unbroken shame. He
did not drink. He was exactly honest. He was never rude to his
employers. Yet he was everywhere discharged. Bringing no interest
to his duties, he brought no attention. His day was a
tissue of things neglected and things done amiss. And from
place to place and from town to town he carried the character
of one thoroughly incompetent."</p>

<p>No one would say that the picture is overdrawn or that the
poor devil got other than his just deserts. In the summing up,
the final judgment that is put on a man by other men depends
on his value as a working hand. If he has other serious personality
faults, they will be overlooked as somewhat beside the
point, provided that he levels with his job. But if he embodies
all of the surface virtues, and is shiftless, any superior with sense
will mark him for the discard, and his coworkers will breathe
a sigh of relief when he has gone on his way.</p>

<p>Within the armed services, the tone of grudging admiration
is never missing from such altogether familiar comments as:</p>

<p>"He's a queer duck but he has what it takes."</p>

<p>"We can't get along with him but we can't get along without
him."</p>

<p>By such words, we unconsciously yield the palm to the man
who, whatever his other shortcomings, excels us in application
to duty. One of the worst rascals ever raised in Britain said that
while he wouldn't give a farthing for virtue, he would pay
10,000 pounds for character, because, possessing it, he would be
able to sell it for much more.</p>

<p>Is it possible then that men of thoroughly good intentions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
will neglect the one value which a knave says is worth prizing?
Not only is it possible; it happens every day! We see officers
of the armed establishment who, thinking themselves employed
all day, would still, if they had to make an honest reckoning
of the score after tattoo sounded, be compelled to say that they
had done exactly nothing. Lacking some compelling duty, they
may have read several hours mechanically, neither studying
what was said, making notes, nor reflecting on the value and
accuracy of it. Such papers as they signed, they had glanced
over perfunctorily. If any subordinate approached them with
some small matter, they reacted by trying to get rid of him as
quickly as possible. When they entered the company of their
fellow officers, they partook of it as little as they could, not
bothering to enter vigorous conversation, failing to make any
note of the character and manner of their associates, and learning
not at all from the words that were said.</p>

<p>It is all good enough, and yet strangely it is neither good nor
is it enough. That idea of what life in the officer corps is meant
to be simply cannot stand up under the pressures of modern
operations. True enough, assignments do not all have the same
level of work requirement, and one is sometimes handed a wide
open opportunity to goldbrick. But taking advantage of it is
like the dope habit; the more that it is sniffed, the greater becomes
the craving of the nervous system. It is harder to throw
off sloth than to keep it from climbing onto one's back in the
first place. And finally, the truth of the matter is this, that there
is never any assignment given an armed service officer which
entitles him to waste any of the working hours of his day.
Though he be marking time in a casual depot or replacement
center, there still awaits his attention the entire range of military
studies, through which he can advance his own abilities.
And if he is not of a mind for tactics, map-reading, military
law, and training doctrine, it still follows that the study of
applied psychology, English composition, economic geography
and foreign languages will further his career. Just as a rough
approximation, any officer's work week should comprise about
50 percent execution and the other half study, if he is to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the best use of his force. The woods are loaded with go-getters
who claim they are men of action and therefore have no need
of books; that they are "the flat-bottoms who can ride over
the dew." Though they are a little breezier, they are of the
same bone and marrow as the drone who is always counseling
halfspeed. "Don't sweat; just get by; extra work means short
life; you're better off if they don't notice you." This chant can
be heard by anyone who cares to listen; it's the old American invitation
to mediocrity. But while mediocre, as commonly used,
means "indifferent, ordinary," it also has in old English the odd
meaning "a young monk who was excused from performing part
of a monk's duties." And that, too, fits. It is always worthwhile
to ask a few very senior officers what they think of these jokers
who refuse to study. They will say that the higher up you go,
the more study you have to make up, because of what you
missed somewhere along the line. They will say also that when
they got to flag or star rank, things didn't ease off a bit.</p>

<p>But not all wisdom is to be found in books, and at no time is
this more true than when one is breaking in. What is expected
of the novice in any field is that he will ask questions, <em>smart ones
if possible</em>, but if not, then questions of all kinds until he learns
that there is no such item as reveille oil and that skirmish line
doesn't come on spools. For on one point there should be no
mistake: the newly appointed officer is a novice. Though many
things go with the commission, the assumption that he is all
wise to all ways of the service, and will automatically fit into
his element as neatly as a loaded ship settles down to its
Plimsoll's mark, just isn't among them. Within the services,
seniors are rarely, if ever, either patronizing or intolerant of the
greenness of a new officer; they just stand ready to help him.
And if he doesn't permit them to have that chance, because he
would rather pretend that he knows it all, they will gradually
become bored with him because of the manifest proof that he
knows so very little.</p>

<p><em>Wisdom begins at the point of understanding that there is
nothing shameful about ignorance; it is shameful only when a
man would rather remain in that state than cultivate other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
men's knowledge.</em> There is never any reason why he should hesitate,
for it is better to be embarrassed from seeking counsel
than to be found short for not having sought it.</p>

<p>In one of the toughest trades in the world of affairs&mdash;that
of the foreign correspondent&mdash;initial dependence upon one's
professional colleagues is the only certain stepping stone to
success. A man arrives in strange country feeling very much
alone. His credentials lack the weight they had at home. The
prestige of his newspaper counts for almost nothing. Even the
name of his home city stirs little respect. The people, their ways,
their approaches and their taboos are foreign to him. This
sweeping environmental change is crushing to the spirit; it
would impose an almost insuperable moral handicap if the newcomer
could not go to other Americans who have already
worked the ground, ask them how the thing is done, seek
their advice about dealing with the main personalities, learn
from them about the facilities for processing copy, and soak up
everything they have to say about private and professional procedures.
Then as the ropes grow gradually familiar in the
grasp, confidence and nervous energy come flooding back.</p>

<p>Surely there is a close parallel between this experience and
that of the journeyman moving from the familiar soil of civilianism
to the <em>terra incognita</em> of military life. But there is also
the marked difference that everyone he meets can tell him
something that he needs to know. More particularly, if he has
the ambition to excel as a commander of men, rather than as a
technician, then the study of human nature and of individual
characteristics within the military crowd become a major part
of his training. That is the prime reason why the life of any
tactical leader becomes so very interesting, provided he possesses
some imagination. Everything is grist for his mill. Moreover,
despite the wholesale transformation in the scientific and industrial
aspects of war, there has been no revolution in the one
thing that counts most. Ardant du Picq's words, "The heart of
man does not change," are as good now as when he said them
in an earlier period of war. Whatever one learns for certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
about the nature of man as a fighting animal can be filed for
ready reference; the hour will come when it will be useful.</p>

<p>We have emphasized the value of becoming curious, and of
asking questions about what one doesn't know, and have said
that even when the questions are a little on the dumb side,
it does no harm. But the ice gets very thin at one point. The
same question asked over and again, like the same error made
more than once, will grate the nerves of any superior. It is the
mark of inattention, and the beginning of that "tissue of things
neglected and things done amiss" which put Stevenson's oddball
character in the ditch. When an officer lets words go in one
ear and out the other like water off a duck's back, to quote the
Dutch janitor, he is chasing rainbows by rubbing fur in the
wrong direction.</p>

<p>Ideally, an officer should be able to do the work of any man
serving under him. There are even some command situations in
which the ideal becomes altogether attainable, and a wholly
practicable objective. For it may be said without qualification,
that if he not only has this capability, but demonstrates it, so
that his men begin to understand that he is thoroughly versed
in the work problems which concern them, <em>he can command
them in any situation</em>. This is the real bedrock of command
capacity, and nothing else so well serves to give an officer an
absolutely firm position with all who serve under him. As said
elsewhere in this book, within the armed establishment, administration
is not of itself a separate art, or a dependable prop
to authority. When administrators talk airily of things that they
clearly do not understand, they are simply using the whip on
the team without having control of the reins.</p>

<p>However, the greater part of military operation in present
days is noteworthy for the extreme diversity and complexity of
its parts, and instead of becoming more simplified, the trend is
toward greater elaboration. It is obviously absurd to expect that
any officer could know more about radio repair than his repairman,
more about mapping than his cartographical section,
more about moving parts than a gunsmith, more about radar
than a specialist in electronics and more about cypher than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
cryptographer. If the services were to set any such unreasonable
standard for the commissioned body, all would shortly move
over into the lunatic fringe. Science has worked a few wonders
for the military establishment but it hasn't told us how to
produce that kind of man.</p>

<p>Plainly, there must be a somewhat different approach to the
question of what kind of knowledge an officer is expected to
possess, or the requirement would be unreasonable and unworkable.</p>

<p><em>The distinction lies in the difference between the power to
do a thing well and that of being able to judge when it is
well done.</em> A man can say that a book is bad, though not
knowing how to write one himself, provided he is a student
of literature. Though he has never laid an egg, he can pass
fair judgment on an omelette, if he knows a little about cookery,
and has sampled many good eggs, and detected a few that
were overripe.</p>

<p>"He who lives in a house," said Aristotle, "is a better judge
of it being good or bad than the builder of it. He can say not
only these things, but wherein its defects consist. Yet he might
be quite unable to cure the chimney, or to draw out a plan for
his rooms which would suit him better. Sometimes he can
even see where the fault is which caused the mischief, and yet
he may not know practically how to remedy it."</p>

<p>Adjustment to a job, and finally, mastery of it, by a service
officer, comes of persistent pursuit of this principle. The main
technique is study and constant reexamination of criteria. To
take the correct measure of standards of performance, as to the
value of the work itself, and as to the abilities of personnel,
one must become immersed in knowledge of the nature, <em>and
purpose</em>, of all operations. There is no shortcut to this grasp
of affairs. The sack is filled bean by bean. Patient application
to one thing at one time is the first rule of success; getting on
one's horse and riding off in all directions is the prelude to
failure. All specialists like to talk about their work; the interest
of any other man is flattering; all men grow in knowledge
chiefly by picking other men's brains. Book study of the subject,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
specialized courses in the service schools, the instructive comments
of one's superiors, the informed criticism of hands further
down the line and the weighing of human experience, at every
source and by every recourse, are the means of an informed
judgment. It was the scientist, Thomas Huxley who reminded
us that science is only "organized common sense."</p>

<p>Other things being equal, the prospect for any man's progress
is largely determined by his attitude. It is the receptive mind,
rather than the oracle, which inspires confidence. General Eisenhower
said at one point that, after 40 years, he still thought of
himself as a student on all military questions, and that he consciously
mistrusted any man who believed he had the full and
final answer to problems which by their nature were ever-changing.</p>

<p>But priggishness about knowledge is not more hurtful than is
the arbitrary use of it to limit action. <em>To rule by work rather
than to work by rules</em> must be the abiding principle in military
operations, for finally, when war comes, nothing else will
suffice. In peacetime, absolute accountability is required, because
dollar economy in operations is a main object. This entails
adherence to rigid forms, time-consuming, but still necessary.
In many of war's exigencies, these forms frequently have to be
swept aside, to bring victory as quickly as possible and to save
human life. In the book, "General Kenney Reports," that great
air commander spoke at one point of a difficulty in one of his
combat groups. "It was a lot of hard-working earnest kids,
officers and enlisted men, who were doing the best they could
under poor living and eating conditions. But their hands were
tied by the colonel in command whose passion for paper work
effectually stopped the issuing of supplies and the functioning
of the place as an air depot should. He told me that he thought
'it was about time these combat units learned how to do their
paper work properly.' I decided that it would be a waste of time
to fool with him so I told him to pack up to go home on the
next plane."</p>

<p>Though this is a tragic example of wrong-headedness, it is by
no means unique. The profession moves ahead, and national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
security advances with it, because of men who have the confidence
and courage to toss the rule book out the window when
it doesn't fit the situation, and who dare to trust their own
decisions and improvise swiftly.</p>

<p>But in all walks of life, this willingness to take hold of the
reins firmly is by no means common among men in relatively
subordinate positions who can play it safe by falling back on
"SOP."</p>

<p>But there is also a far wider vista than that which is to be
viewed only within the services themselves, and its horizons are
almost infinite. The American way in warfare utilizes everything
within the national system which may be applied to a
military purpose toward the increase of training and fighting
efficiency. Much of our potential strength lies in our industrial
structure, our progress in science, our inventiveness and our
educational resources. Toward the end that all of these assets
will be given maximum use, and every good idea which can be
converted to a military purpose will be in readiness to serve
the nation when war comes, there must be a continuing meeting
of minds between military leadership and the leaders and
experts in these various fields during peace.</p>

<p>That union cannot be perfected, however, unless there is a
sufficient number of men on both sides of the table who can
think halfway into the field of the man opposite. Just as the
civilian expert in electronics, airplane manufacture or motion
picture production needs to know more about the military
establishment's problem and requirements if he is to do his
part, the service officer with whom he is dealing needs to be
informed on industry's resources, possibilities and limitations if
he is to enable the civilian side to do its part well. The same for
science. The same for education, and all other backers of the
fighting force.</p>

<p>An enlightened Englishman, D. W. Brogan, in a book written
during World War II, "The American Character," gave us this
thought: "The American officer must think in terms of material
resources, existing but not organized in peacetime and taking
much time and thought and experiment by trial and error to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
make available in wartime. He finds that his best peacetime plans
are inadequate for one basic reason: that any plan which in
peacetime really tried to draw adequately on American resources
would cause its author to be written off as a madman; and in
wartime, it would prove to have been inadequate, pessimistic,
not allowing enough for the practically limitless resources of
the American people&mdash;limitless once the American people get
ready to let them be used. And only war can get them ready for
that. The American officer can draw then, but not before, on
an experience in economic improvization and in technical adaptation
which no other country can equal."</p>

<p>This is true to the last syllable, and it means in essence that
unless the American officer can think of the whole nation as his
workshop, and along with his other duties, will apply himself as
a student, seeking to understand more and more about the
richness and the adaptability of our tremendous resources, neither
he nor the country will be relatively ready when war comes.</p>

<p>There is a last point to be made on the matter of attitude.
The most resolute opposition to changes in any system usually
comes from those who control them. That is universally true,
and not peculiar to military systems; but the services are foremost
in recognizing that, as a consequence, the encouragement
of original thought at the lower levels is essential to over-all
progress.</p>

<p>All depends upon the manner. We can ponder the words of
William Hazlitt, "A man who shrinks from a collision with his
equals or superiors will soon sink below himself; we improve
by trying our strength with others, not by showing it off." They
are good so far as they go, but something new should be added.
There is a vast difference between contending firmly for ideas
that seem progressive when one is reasonably sure of one's data,
and the habit of throwing one's weight around through a mistaken
belief that this of itself manifests an independence of
spirit which inspires respect.</p>

<p>Truculence can never win the day. Restraint, tolerance, a
sense of humor and of proportion and the force of logic are the
marks of the man qualified for intellectual leading. Within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
services, even though he has no great rank, there is practically
nothing he cannot carry through, if his proposals have the color
of reason and propriety, and if he will keep his head, keep his
temper, and keep his word.</p>

KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR MEN</h3>


<p>An admiring contemporary spoke of Paul G. Hoffman, the
director of the European Recovery Program, as "the kind of
man who if tossed through the air would always pick out the
right trapeze."</p>

<p>Within any military organization, there is always a number of
such men, enlisted and commissioned. They know how and
where to take hold, even in the face of a totally unexpected and
unnerving situation, and they have what amounts to an instinct
for doing the right thing in a decisive moment.</p>

<p>If it were not so, no captain of the line would ever be able to
manage a company in battle, and no submarine commander
would be able to cope with an otherwise overwhelming danger.
These men are the foundation of unit integrity. The successful
life of organization depends upon husbanding, and helping them
to cultivate, their own powers, which means that their initiative
and vigor must never be chilled by supercilious advice and
thoughtless correction.</p>

<p>They will go ahead and act responsibly on their own when
given the confidence, and if they want it, the friendship, of their
commander. But they cannot be treated like little children. The
lash will ruin them and the curb will merely subdue that which
needs to be brought forward. As in handling a horse with a
good temper and a good mouth, nothing more is needed than
that gentle touch of the rein which signals that things are
under control.</p>

<p>From where the executive sits, the main secret of building
strength within organization comes of identifying such men, and
of associating one's authority with theirs, so it is unmistakable
in whose name they are speaking and acting. One of the
acid tests of qualification in officership is the ability properly
to delegate authority, to put it in the best hands, and thereafter
to uphold them. If an officer cannot do that, and if he is mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>trustful
of all power save his own, he cannot command in
peace, and when he goes into battle, his unit strength will
fragment like an exploding bomb, and the parts will not be rewelded
until some stronger character takes hold.</p>

<p><em>Command is not a prerogative, but rather a responsibility to
be shared with all who are capable of filling up the spaces in
orders and of carrying out that which is not openly expressed
though it may be understood.</em> Admittedly, it is not easy for a
young officer, who by reason of his youth is not infrequently
lacking in self-assurance and in the confidence that he can
command respect, to understand that as a commander he can
grow in strength in the measure that he succeeds in developing
the latent strength of his subordinates. But if he stubbornly
resists this premise as he goes along in the service, his personal resources
will never become equal to the strain which will be imposed
upon him, come a war emergency. The power to command
resides largely in the ability to see when a proper initiative
is being exercised and in giving it moral encouragement.
When an officer feels that way about his job and his men, he
will not be ready to question any action by a junior which
might be narrowly construed as an encroachment upon his own
authority. Of this last evil come the restraints which reduce
men to automatons, giving only that which is asked, or less,
according to the pressing of a button.</p>

<p>There are other men who have as sound a potential as these
already-made leaders, but lack the initial confidence because
they were not constructively handled in earlier years. They require
somewhat more personal attention, for the simple reason
that more frequent contact with their superiors, words of approval
and advice as needed, will do more than all else to
put bottom under them. They must be encouraged to think for
themselves as well as to obey orders, to organize as well as to
respond, if they are to become part of the solution, rather than
remaining part of the problem, of command. If left wholly to
their own devices, or to the ministrations of less thoughtful
subordinates, they will remain in that majority which moves
only when told. It takes no more work, though it does require<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
imagination, to awaken the energies of such men by appealing
to their intelligence and their self-interest, than to nauseate
them with dull theory, and to cramp them by depriving them
of responsibility.</p>

<p>Careful missionary work among these "sleepers" is as productive
as spading the ground, and sprinkling a garden patch.
When an officer takes hold in a new unit, his main chance of
making it better than it was comes of looking for the overlooked
men. He uses his hand to give them a firm lift upward,
but it will not be available for that purpose if he spends any
of his time tugging at men who are already on their feet and
moving in the right general direction.</p>

<p>In the words of a distinguished armored commander in our
forces: "To the military leader, men are tools. He is successful
to the extent that he can get the men to work for him. Ordinarily,
and on their own initiative, people run on only 35 percent
capacity. The success of a leader comes of tapping the
other 65 percent." This is a pretty seasoned judgment on men
in the mass, taking them as they come, the mobile men, the
slow starters, the indifferent and the shiftless. Almost every man
wants to do what is expected of him. When he does not do so,
it is usually because his instructions have been so doubtful as
to befog him or give him a reasonable excuse for noncompliance.
This view of things is the only tenable attitude an officer
or enlisted leader can take toward his subordinates. He will
recognize the exceptions, and if he does not then take appropriate
action, it is only because he is himself shiftless and is
compassionate toward others of his own fraternity.</p>

<p>It is the military habit to "plow deep in broken drums and
shoot crap for old crowns," as the poet, Carl Sandburg, put it.
As much as any other profession, and even possibly a little
more, we take pride in the pat solution, and in proof that long-applied
processes amply meet the test of newly unfolding experience.
But despite all the jests about the Gettysburg Map,
we wouldn't know where we're going if we couldn't be reasonably
sure of where we've been.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is as well to say now that from all of the careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
searching made by the armed services as to the fighting characteristics
of Americans during World War II, not a great deal
was learned in addition to what was already well known, or
surmised. The criteria that had been used in the prior system
of selection proved to be substantially correct; at least, if it
had faults, they were innate in the complex problem of weighing
human material, and were beyond correction by any rule of
thumb or judgment. Men were chosen to lead because of
personality, intelligence at their work, response to orders, ability
to lead in fatigues or in the social affairs of organization, and
disciplinary record. In combat these same men carried 95 percent
of the load of responsibility and provided the dynamic for
the attack. But in every unit, there was almost invariably a
small sprinkling of individuals, who having shown no prior
ability when measured by the customary yardsticks of courtesy,
discipline and work, became strong and vital in any situation
calling for heroic action. They could fight, they could lead,
they knew what should be done, they could persuade other men
to rally around, and by these things, they could command instantly
the previously withheld respect of their superiors.</p>

<p>Neither the scientific nor the military mind has yet been able
to provide the answer as to how men of this type&mdash;so indispensable
to the fighting establishment in the thing that matters
most, though lacking in strong surface characteristics&mdash;can be
detected beforehand, and conserved, instead of being wasted
possibly in a labor or housekeeping organization.</p>

<p>All concerned recognize the extreme importance of the problem,
and would like to do something about it. What is as yet
not even vaguely seen is the large possibility that the problem
might be self-liquidating if all junior officers became more concerned
with learning all they could about the private character
and personal nature of their subordinates. This does not mean
invading their privacy; but it implies giving every man a fair
chance to open up and to talk freely, without fear of contempt.
It means studying the background of a man even more
carefully than one would read a map, looking for the key to
command of the terrain. These are usually repressed men; many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of the foreign-born are to be found among them; they cover up
because of pride, but they are not afraid of physical danger.
Once any man, and particularly a superior, gets through the
outer shell, he may have the effect of a catalyst on what is
happening inside. If such men did not have basic loyalty, they
would never fight. When at last they give their loyalty to an
individual, they are usually his to command and will go through
hell for him.</p>

<p>There was an Oklahoma miner named Alvin Wimberley in
90th Division during World War I. On the drill field, he could do
nothing correctly. He couldn't step off on the left foot; he would
frequently drop his piece while trying to do right shoulder. Solely
because his case was unfathomable, his platoon leader asked
that he be taken to France with the unit instead of separated
with the culls. At the front, Wimberley immediately took the
lead in every detail of a dangerous sort, such as exploding a
mine field, or hunting for traps and snares. His nerve was inexhaustible;
his judgment sure. There was, after all, a simple
key to the mystery. Wimberley had led a solitary life as a dynamiter,
deep under ground. He was frightened of men, but danger
was his element. When he saw other men recoil at the thing
which bothered him not at all, he realized that he was the big
man, though he only stood 5 feet 3 inches in issue socks.</p>

<p>To know men, it is not necessary to wet-nurse them, and no
officer can make a sorrier mistake than to take the overly nice,
worrying attitude toward them. This, after all, is simply the rule
of the well-bred man, rather than an item peculiar to the code
of the military officer. But it is a little less becoming in a service
officer than in anyone else, because, when a man puts on
fighting clothes in the name of his country, it is an insult to treat
him as if he were a juvenile.</p>

<p>In any situation where men need to know one another better,
someone has to break the ice. Where does the main responsibility
lie within a military unit? True enough, the junior has to
salute first, and in some services is supposed to say, "Good
morning!" first, though beating a man to the draw with a greeting
is one way to win him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>However, the main point is this: unless an officer has himself
been an enlisted man, it is almost impossible for him to
know how formidable, and even forbidding, rank at first seems
to the eyes of the man down under, even though he would be
loath to say so.</p>

<p>Many recruits have such a mistaken hearsay impression of
the United States military system, that it is for them a cause for
astonishment that any officer enjoys free discussion with them.
They feel at first that there is a barrier there which only the
officer is entitled to cross; it takes them a little while to learn
better.</p>

<p>But in the continuing relationship, it is the habit of the
average well-disciplined enlisted man to remain reticent, and
talk only on official matters, unless the officer takes the lead in
such way as to invite general conversation. For that matter, the
burden is the same anywhere in the service in relations between
a senior officer and his subordinates, and the former
must take the lead if he expects to really know his men.</p>

<p>Many newly joined officers believe, altogether mistakenly, that
there is some strange taboo against talking to men except in line
of duty, and that if caught at it, it will be considered <em>infra dig</em>.
There is always the hope that they will remain around long
enough to learn better.</p>

WRITING AND SPEAKING</h3>


<p>Other things being equal, a superior rating will invariably
be given to the officer who has persevered in his studies of the
art of self-expression, while his colleague, who attaches little
importance to what may be achieved through working with the
language, will be marked for mediocrity.</p>

<p>A moment's reflection will show why this has to be the case
and why mastery of the written and spoken word is indispensable
to successful officership.</p>

<p>As the British statesman, Disraeli, put it, "Men govern with
words." Within the military establishment, command is exercised
through what is said which commands attention and
understanding and through what is written which directs, explains,
interprets or informs.</p>

<p>Battles are won through the ability of men to express concrete
ideas in clear and unmistakable language. All administration is
carried forward along the chain of command by the power of
men to make their thoughts articulate and available to others.</p>

<p>There is no way under the sun that this basic condition can
be altered. Once the point is granted, any officer should be
ready to accept its corollary&mdash;that superior qualification in the
use of the language, both as to the written and the spoken
word, is more essential to military leadership than knowledge
of the whole technique of weapons handling.</p>

<p>It then becomes strictly a matter of personal decision whether
he will seek to advance himself along the line of main chance or
will take refuge in the excuse offered by the great majority:
"I'm just a simple fighting file with no gift for writing or
speaking."</p>

<p>How often these or similar words are heard in the armed
services! And the pity of it is that they are usually uttered in a
tone indicating that the speaker believes some special virtue
attaches to his kind of ignorance. There is the unmistakable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
innuendo that the man who pays serious attention to the fundamentals
of the business of communication is somehow less
possessed of sturdy military character than himself. There could
hardly be a more absurd or disadvantageous professional conceit
than this. It is the mark only of an officer who has no
ambition to properly qualify himself, and is seeking to justify
his own laziness.</p>

<p>Not all American military leaders have been experts at polishing
a phrase or giving clear expression and continuity to the
thoughts which made them useful in command. But of those
who have excelled in the conduct of great operations, at least
four out of five made some mark in the field of letters. A long
list would include such names as U. S. Grant, W. T. Sherman,
Robert E. Lee, John J. Pershing, James G. Harbord, Henry
T. Allen, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George S. Patton, Jr., H. H.
Arnold, Douglas MacArthur, William F. Halsey, W. B. Smith,
Joseph W. Stilwell, Holland M. Smith, and Robert L. Eichelberger
among many others.</p>

<p>Of them all, it can be said without exception that they
acquired their skill at self-expression by sustained practice which
was part of a self-imposed training in the interests of furthering
their military efficiency. No one of them was a born writer.
There is no such thing. Nor did any one of them owe his
abilities as a writer to any other person. Writers are self-made.
But it is a reasonable speculation that history might never
have heard of the greater number of these men had they not
worked sedulously to become proficient with the pen as well as
with the sword. Granting that they had other sound military
qualities in the beginning, an acquired ability to express themselves
lucidly and with force became a touchstone to preferment.
The same thing holds true of their celebrated military
contemporaries almost without exception. Even those who had
no public reputation for authorship, and would have been ill at
ease if called upon to speak to an average audience, knew how
to use the language in presenting their thoughts to their staffs
and their troops, whether the occasion called for a succinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
operational order, a doctrinal exposition or an inspirational
message on the eve of battle.</p>

<p>Wherever one looks, the same precept may be noted. It was
not coincidence merely, but related cause and effect, that
Ferdinand Foch was one of the ablest military writers of the
twentieth century before he won immortality on the field of
war, that the elder von Moltke was as skilled with ink as with
powder, and that we still marvel at the picture of the great
von Steuben dictating drill manuals far into the night so that
there would be greater perfection in his formations on the following
day. The command of language was one of the main
sources of their power over the multitude.</p>

<p>As it was with these commanders, so it is with leadership at
every level: <em>Men who can command words to serve their
thoughts and feelings are well on their way to commanding men
to serve their purposes.</em></p>

<p>All senior commanders respect the junior who has a facility
for thinking an idea through and then expressing it comprehensively
in clear, unvarnished phrases. Moreover, even when
they are stilted in their own manner of expression, they will
warm to the man whose style achieves strength through its ease
and naturalness. They will quickly make note of any young
officer who is making progress in this direction and will want to
have him around. He is a rare bird in the services, and for that
reason his opportunities are far above the average. Staff work
could not be carried forward at any of its levels if it were not
for this particular talent, and command would lose a great
part of its magnetism.</p>

<p>Toward the building of a career, the best break that can come
to any young man is to have three or four places bidding
simultaneously for his services. There are possibly better arguments
than that as to why perfection in writing should be a
main pursuit of the service officer, such as the sense of personal
attainment which comes of it.</p>

<p>Any man who has the brain to qualify for commission can
make of himself a competent writer. Because of natural limitations,
he may never come to excel in this art. But if he has had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
average schooling, knows how to open a dictionary, can find his
way to a library, is willing to commit himself to long study and
practice, particularly in nonduty hours, and will finally free himself
of the superstition that writing is a game only for specialists,
he can acquire all the skill that is necessary to further his advance
within the military profession.</p>

<p>That is the great difference between writing ability and
specialized knowledge in such fields as electronics and atomic
research.</p>

<p>But where should work begin? How about a little practical
advice?</p>

<p>The only way to learn to write is to write. That is it&mdash;there
is no other secret than hard, unremitting practice. Most
writers at the start are mentally muscle-bound, and poorly coordinated.
They have thoughts in their heads. They think they
can develop them clearly. But when they try to apply a largely
dormant vocabulary to the expression of these thoughts, the
result is stiff and selfconscious.</p>

<p>The only cure for this is constant mental exercise, with one's
pen, or over one's typewriter. After a man has written perhaps
a half million relatively useless words there comes, sometimes
almost in a flash, and at other times gradually, a mastery not
only of words, but of phrases, sentences and the composition of
ideas. It is a kind of rhythmic process, like learning to swim, or
to row a boat, or navigate an airplane. When a writer has at
last conquered his element, his personality and his character
can be transmitted to paper. What is said will reflect the force,
adaptability, reason and musing of the writer. In fact, the
discipline through which one learns to write adds substance
to thought, whereby one's ideas are given body and connection.
Such common faults as wordiness, overstatement, faulty sentence
structure and weak use of words are gradually corrected.
With their passing, confidence grows. This does not mean, however,
that the task then becomes easy. Though its rewards will
increase, good writing continues to be a strain even to the man
who does it well. Many celebrated men of letters never get
beyond the "sweating" stage, but have to fight their way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
through a jungle of words, and rewrite almost endlessly, before
finding satisfaction in their product.</p>

<p>This description makes it all seem more than a little formidable.
But what was promised in the first place was that any
service officer, who will accept the necessary discipline, can
make himself reasonably proficient as a writer, and thereby
further his professional progress. What he writes about during
the conditioning period makes very little difference. It might
be an operational order one night, a treatise on discipline the
next, a lecture to his men on the elements of combat the third.
Fortunately, the list of topics within the services and directly
applicable to their operations, is practically inexhaustible. That
is a main reason why the military establishment is a better
school for writing than perhaps any other place in our society.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill, whose gift of forceful expression is the
envy of all other writing men, won his literary spurs in his
early twenties as a soldier with the Malakand Field Force. He
saw the essential idea&mdash;that to learn English, he had literally
to learn, just as though he had been acquiring Latin or
French. As a writer, his main strength is his employment of
Anglo-Saxon, the words of our common speech.</p>

<p>But simply to take regular exercise in composition is not
quite enough. Of it would come the shadow but not the substance.
To progress as a writer, one must become a student of
the best things which have been written by men who understand
their craft. A military officer can do that without going
beyond the field of military studies, if that should be his disposition,
such is the richness and variation of available works
in this realm of literature. The purpose at hand is not only to
seek great ideas for their own sake but to make careful note of
the manner in which they are expressed. So doing, one unconsciously
invigorates his own powers and adopts techniques
which the masters have used to great advantage.</p>

<p>To paraphrase what a distinguished journalist once said on
this subject in a speech to young writers: "For an officer it is
in the first place a shame to be ignorant&mdash;ignorant, as not a
few are, of history and geography: and in the second place, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
is a pity that any officer should lack a vigor in writing which
can be produced through imitation of vigorous writers."</p>

<p>As to what is best worth seeking, a man can not go wrong by
"falling in love" with the works of a relatively limited number
of authors who kindle him personally. It is all right to widen
the field occasionally, for diversion, for contrast, for sharpening
style, and for balancing of ideas, but strength comes of finding a
main line and holding to it. No man can read a book with
sympathetic understanding without taking from it something
that makes him more complex and more potent.</p>

<p>The main test is in this: if you read a book and feel stirred
by it, even though alternately you strongly agree with certain of
its passages and warmly contend against others, something
new has been added. The writer is making you see things. Your
own powers of observation are being made more acute. All
good writers are in a sense hitch-hikers. While going along for
the ride, and enjoying the essence of some highly developed
mind, they are not loath to study the technique by which some
other man develops his driving power, and to make note of his
strong words and best phrases for possible future use.</p>

<p>It is a good habit to underscore passages in books which have
contributed something vital to one's own thought&mdash;always
provided that the books have not been borrowed.</p>

<p>Without mentioning names, we can take a cue from a man
who some years ago entered one of the services while still a
youth. He had had little formal education, but he began an
earnest study of military literature, and the search for knowledge
whetted his thirst to join the company of those who could speak
to the world because they had something to say. He read such
books as were at hand, and clipped pieces from magazines and
newspapers which had particularly appealed to him, for one
reason or another. Whenever he saw a new word, he wrote it
down and sought the meaning in the dictionary, considering
whether it had a shade of meaning which added anything
important to his vocabulary. This done, he wrote sentences,
many sentences, employing his new words in various ways, until
their use became instinctive. On this foundation alone, he built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
his career as a national writer. There was nothing extraordinary
about this start and the ultimate result. Literally thousands of
Americans have qualified themselves for one branch or another
of the writing profession by what they learned to do in military
service. Too, an ability to "organize a good paper" has been a
large element in the success of most of the men who have moved
from the military circle into top posts in the diplomatic service,
in education or in industrial administration. Had they been
capable only of delegating this kind of work, their powers
would never have been recognized.</p>

<p>As a practical matter, it is better to concentrate on a few
elementary rules-of-thumb, such as are contained in the following
list, than to bog down attempting to heed everything that
the pedants have said about how to become a writer.</p>

<ul>
<li>The more simply a thing is said the more powerfully it
influences those who read. Plain words make strong writing.</li>

<li>There is always one best word to convey a thought or a
feeling. To accept a weaker substitute, rather than to
Search for the right word, will deprive any writing of force.</li>

<li>Economy of words invigorates composition.</li>

<li>To quote Carl Sandburg: "Think twice before you use
an adjective."</li>

<li>It is better to use the adverb because an adverb enhances
the verb and is active, whereas the adjective simply
loads down the noun.</li>

<li>On the other hand, it is the verb that makes language
live. Nine times out of ten the verb is the operative word
giving motion to the sentence. Hence, placing the verb is
of first importance in giving strength to sentence structure.</li>

<li>In all writing, but in military writing particularly, there
is no excuse for vague terminology or phrases which do not
convey an exact impression of what was done or what is
intended. The military vocabulary is laden with words and
expressions which sound professional but do not have
definite meaning. They vitiate speech and the establishment
would gladly rid itself of them if a way could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
found. Men fall into the habit of saying "performed,"
"functioned" or "executed" and forget that "did" is in the
dictionary. A captain along the MLR (main line of resistance)
notifies his battalion commander that he has "advanced
his left flank" when all that has actually occurred
is that six riflemen from the left have crawled forward to
new, and possibly, untenable ground.</li>

<li>It is better at all times to <em>rein in</em>. The strength of military
writing, like the soundness of military operations, does
not gain through overstatement and artificial coloring. The
bigger the subject, the less it needs embroidery.</li>

<li>For lucidity and sincerity, the important thing is to say
what you have to say in whatever words most accurately
express your own thoughts. That done, it is pointless to
worry about the effect on the audience.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list of suggestions could be extended indefinitely. But
enough has already been said to stake out a main line for those
who have already decided that this subject deserves their interest.</p>

<p>A majority of the world's most gifted writers would in all
probability be struck dumb if put before an audience; though
dealing confidently with ideas, they lack confidence when dealing
with people. The military officer has need of both talents,
and as to where the accent should be placed, it is probably more
important that he should speak well than that his writing prose
should be polished. A unit commander may permit a clerk or
a subordinate to do the greater part of his paper work, either
because his own time is taken with other duties or because he
is awkward at it, but if he permits any other voice to dominate
the councils of the organization, he soon ceases to exercise moral
authority over it.</p>

<p>Of this there is no question. The judgment men take of their
superior is formed as much by what he says and how he says
it as by his action.</p>

<p>The matter of nerve is a main element in speaking. When an
officer is ill at ease, fidgety and not to the point, the vote of his
command for the time being is "no confidence," and so long as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
he remains that way, they will not change, no matter though
his good will shines forth through other acts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the military crowd is an extremely sympathetic
audience. It has to be; it is drawing pay for so being.
But even if that were not true, the ranks have a generous spirit
and are ever disposed to give the newcomer an even break.
If he meets them confidently and calmly, measures his words,
smiles at his own mistakes and breaks it off when he has
covered his subject, they'll pay no attention to his little fumbles,
and they'll approve him. There is no better way to pick up
prestige than through instruction or discourse which commands
attention, for despite all that is said in favor of the "strong,
silent man," troops like an officer who is outgiving, and who
has an intelligence that they can respect because they have seen
it at work.</p>

<p>As for <em>how</em> an officer should talk to men, his manner and
tone should be no different than if he were addressing his fellow
officers, or for that matter, a group of his intellectual and
political peers from any walk of life. If he is stuffy, he will not
succeed anywhere. If he affects a superior manner, that is a
mark of his inferiority. If he is patronizing, and talks to grown
men as a teacher might talk to a class of adolescents, the rug,
figuratively, will be pulled from under him. His audience will
put him down as a chump.</p>

<p>It is curiously the case that the junior officer who can't get the
right pitch when he talks to the ranks will also be out of tune
when he talks to his superiors. This failing is a sign mainly that
he needs practice in the school of human nature. By listening a
little more carefully to other men, he may himself in time attain
maturity.</p>

<p>Concerning subject matter, it is better always to aim high
than to take the risk of shooting too low. It is too often the
practice to spell out everything in words of one syllable so that
the more witless files in the organization will be able to understand
it. When that is done, it insults the intelligence of the
keenest men, and nothing is added to their progress. The target
should be the intellect of the upper 25 or 30 percent. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
they are stimulated and informed, they will bring the others
along, and even those who do not fully understand all that was
under discussion will have heard something to which to aspire.
<em>The habit of talking down to troops is one of the worst vices
that can afflict an officer.</em></p>

<p>There are no dull lecture topics; there are only dull lecturers.
A little eager research will enliven any subject under the sun.
Good lecturing causes men's imaginations to be stirred by vivid
images. Real good is accomplished only when they talk to
each other of what they have heard and sharpen their impressions.
Schopenauer somewhere observes that "people in
general have eyes and ears, but not much else&mdash;little judgment
and even little memory," which isn't far wrong. Consequently,
competent lecturing entails the employment of every technique
which can be used to hammer a point home. In this way, a
truth or a lesson has a better chance of adhering because it is
identified with some definite image. Simply to illuminate this
point, it is noted that the jests which best stick in the memory
are those which are associated with some incongruous situation.
To relate a pertinent anecdote, to provide an apt quotation
from some well-known authority and to draw upon our own
rich battle history for illustrative materials are but a few of the
means of freshening any discussion and sharpening its purpose.
Men are always ready to listen to the story of other men's experience
provided that it is told with vigor. And insofar as combat
is concerned, such teaching is in point, for what has happened
once will happen again.</p>

<p>For his way as an instructor of young infantry officers of the
A. E. F. in 1918, Lt. Col. H. M. Hutchinson of the British Army
was awarded our D. S. M. Officers who sat at his feet at
Gondrecourt were unlikely ever to forget the point of such an
anecdote as:</p>

<p>"There will be no 'Stack arms' in my army. It is a thing one
sees on a brewer's calendar&mdash;The Soldier's Dream&mdash;showing
a brave private sleeping under a stack of rifles which it will
take him a good half-hour to untangle when the call comes to
stand to. No, a soldier had better carry the rifle with him to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
meals, have it beside him always, lavish his care upon it, and
in short treat it more like a wife than a weapon.</p>

<p>"I am reminded of the times in South Africa when we would
come to a country inn where a chap could stop for beer. Well,
a soldier would walk into the place, and immediately he would
stand his rifle in a corner&mdash;like an umbrella, you know&mdash;'We've
arrived!'&mdash;and he'd get well into his beer and a song,
say, and suddenly firing would break out on the inn from four
sides.</p>

<p>"It seemed that a Boer had slipped into the entry and picked
up all the rifles and passed them around to his mates in the
bushes, and&mdash;well&mdash;there you are!"</p>

<p>As a cadet and later as an instructor at Sandhurst, Colonel
Hutchinson well knew the usefulness of the anecdote in catching
and holding the attention of the young. Who could forget
the lesson in this, related at Gondrecourt:</p>

<p>"In my youth I was a dashing ignoramus with clearer ideas
than I now have on the line of demarcation between the officer
and his men. They sent me out to South Africa during the
trouble and I brought a detachment into a country village. It
seemed quite unpromising but I was told of a sort of place 3
miles in the country that you would call a chateau in France.
So I cantered out and spent the night, turning my men over
to a sergeant-major. After a refreshing breakfast along in the
middle of the morning&mdash;the late middle of the morning&mdash;I
rode back into town, but try as I might I could not locate a
single one of my men.</p>

<p>"Now nothing, you know, is as ineffective in a war as an
officer without his men. Well, I spent the day in agony and it
was not until along at dusk that the first of the blighters
straggled in&mdash;quite drunk, all of them, and swearing to a man
that they had engaged in five ferocious battles. It seems that
about 2 miles away, in a barn, they had come on a hogshead of
ginger brandy, and had stayed with it to the bitter end. Need
I say that it was a great lesson to me, and that from then on I
was never billeted farther than 15 rods from my men.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I love ginger brandy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Or this, in which the whole lesson of exactitude in the written
communication is implicit:</p>

<p>"Now on the subject of messages, it might be well to say
immediately that as far as I know no one ever received a written
message during a battle. They may be written, but that I
think is as far as it goes. However, they are occasionally received
before and after battles, and in this connection let me
say that it is no earthly good writing generalities to signify
times and places.</p>

<p>"I mean to say, suppose you are writing a message and you
write 'Report after breakfast.' Well, to Sergeant Ramrod it
might mean stand-to at 3 in the morning; while to Captain
Brighteyes it would mean, say, 8 o'clock. But to Colonel Blue-fish
it would signify some time after 11, depending quite a bit
on how the old fellow felt.</p>

<p>"So it is better to say 7 o'clock in the morning, if that is
what you mean, for after all there is only one 7 o'clock in the
morning. And, by the way, I must warn you chaps against the
champagne on sale in the Cafe de l'Univers down here in the
square. It is made in the basement&mdash;of potatoes."</p>

<p>On as simple and basic a thing as continuing liaison between
small units, the Colonel's listeners never forgot his elementary
parable:</p>

<p>"One rule is about all a chap can handle in a battle, and as
good a one as any to remember is to keep in some sort of touch
with the chaps to your right and left. If you do this&mdash;and I
dare say you Americans will have as much trouble as ourselves
in remembering to&mdash;then a great deal of distress to yourselves
and all hands will be obviated.</p>

<p>"Now here we have a triangular wood. There is to be an
attack, and the objective is this line beyond the wood. So on
this side of the wood at the hour of attack the Welsh Guards
go forward&mdash;and on this side, here, the Inniskilling Fusiliers,
and a tremendous battle ensues. Well, after an hour or two,
with not much progress, it is discovered that the Welsh Guards
have been firing into the Inniskilling Fusiliers, and the Fusiliers
have been firing into the Welsh. This is thought a bit thick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
you know, even in the confusion of battle. So eventually it is
stopped."</p>

<p>Some of the experts warn the lecturer who is only a beginner
against the use of humor, commenting that if a joke is
unlaughed at, it is disconcerting to all concerned. The only
intelligent answer to that is: "Well, what of it?" The speaker
who is going to cringe every time one of his passages falls a little
flat had best not start. This happens at times to every lecturer;
there are good days and bad days, live audiences and sour ones.
If a man takes his work seriously, it is hardly within nature for
him to harden his emotions against an unexpectedly dull reaction.
But he can keep from ever showing that he is upset if as
a speaker he consciously forms the habit of rapidly driving on
from one point to another.</p>

<p>Thus as to the use of humor in public address, it is not only
an asset but almost a necessity. It is better to try with it, and
to fall flat occasionally, thereby sharpening one's own wit
through better understanding of what goes and what does not,
than to attempt to go along humorlessly. Said William Pitt:
"Don't tell me of a man's being able to talk sense. Everyone can
talk sense. Can he talk a little nonsense?" Even more to the
point is the remark of Thomas Hardy that men thin away to
insignificance quite as often by not making the most of good
spirits when they have them as by lacking good spirits when
they are indispensable. Fighting is much too serious a trade to
have a large place for men who are dry as dust.</p>

<p>One of the spellbinders of ancient Greece, we are told,
orated on the sands with his mouth filled with pebbles. In
World War I, it was the custom of many higher commanders
to take their officers out for voice exercises and have them talk
through 150 feet of thicket; they were not satisfied unless the
words came through distinctly on the far side. If, under average
acoustical conditions, a military officer cannot get across to five
hundred men, he needs to improve his voice placement. It is
remarkable what miracles can be worked by consistent exercise
of the vocal cords.</p>

<p>The final thought is that it is all a matter of buildup. An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
officer can cut his audience to his own size, and strengthen his
powers and his confidence as he goes along. That is his supreme
advantage. He can start with a short talk to a minor working
detail and move from that to a more formal address before a
slightly larger group. By taking it gradually, and increasing his
store of knowledge in the interim period, he will see the time
come when he can hold any audience in the hollow of his hand.
This is precisely the routine which was followed by most of
the military leaders who have been celebrated for their command
of speech.</p>

THE ART OF INSTRUCTION</h3>



<ul>
<li><em>Keep it simple.</em></li>

<li><em>Have but one main object.</em></li>

<li><em>Stay on the course.</em></li>

<li><em>Remain cheerful.</em></li>

<li><em>Be enthusiastic.</em></li>

<li><em>Put it out as if the ideas were as interesting and novel to you,
as to your audience.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>By abiding by these few simple rules you will keep cool,
preserve continuity and hold your audience.</p>

<p>Instruction is just about the begin-all and end-all of every
military officer's job. He spends the greater part of his professional
life either pitching it or catching it, and the game
doesn't stop until he is at last retired. Should he become a
Supreme Commander, even, this is one thing that does not
change; it remains a give-and-take proposition. Part of his
time is taken instructing his staff as to what he wants done
and just as much of it is spent in being instructed by his staff
as to the means available for the doing of it.</p>

<p>Instruction is the generator of unified action. It is the transmission
belt by which the lessons of experience are passed to
untrained men. Left uninstructed, men may progress only by
trial-and-error and the hard bumps which come of not knowing
the way.</p>

<p>Need more than that be said to suggest that the officer who
builds a competent skill in this field, so that it becomes a part
of his reputation, has at the same time built the most solid
kind of a foundation under his service career?</p>

<p>The services do not discard that kind of man when the
economy pinch comes and the establishment has to contract.
The Reservist, who is known as a good instructor, is always on
the preferred list. In any period of emergency, such officers
move rapidly to the top; there are always more good jobs than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
there are good men. Look back over the lineup of distinguished
commanders from World War II! It will be found that the
high percentage of them first attracted notice by <em>being good
school men</em>.</p>

<p>Within the services, in all functions related to the passing
on of information, the accent is on "knowing your stuff." The
point is substantial, but not conclusive. It is upon the way that
instruction is delivered rather than upon its contents as such
that its moral worth rests. The pay-off is not in what is said,
but in what sinks in. <em>A competent instructor will not only
teach his men but will increase his prestige in the act.</em> There
are many inexpressibly dull bores who know what they're talking
about, but still haven't learned how to say it, because they
are contemptuous of the truth that it is the dynamic flow of
knowledge, rather than the static possession of it, which is the
means to power and influence. As technicians, they have their
place. As instructors, they would be better off if they knew
only half as much about their subject, and twice as much
about people.</p>

<p>To know where truth lies is not more important than knowing
how to pitch it. Take the average American military audience:
what can be said fairly of its main characteristics?
Perhaps this&mdash;that it is moderately reflective; that it is ready
to give the untried speaker a break; that it does not like
windiness, bombast or prolonged moralizing; that it refuses to be
bullied; and that it can usually be won by the light touch and
a little appeal to its sporting instinct. It is the little leavening in
the bread which makes all the difference in its savor and
digestibility.</p>

<p>In World War I an American major, name now long forgotten,
was given the task of making the rounds of the cantonments,
talking to all combat formations, and convincing
them that the future was bright&mdash;no Boy Scout errand.
But wherever he went, morale was lifted by his words. In substance,
what he said was this:</p>

<p>"None of us cares about living with any individual who
wants every break his own way. But when the odds are even,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the gamble is worth any good man's time. So let's look at the
proposition. You now have one chance in two; you may go
overseas, you may not. Suppose you do. You still have one
chance in two. You may go to the front, or you may not. If
you don't, you'll see a foreign country at Uncle Sam's expense;
if you do, you'll find out about war, which is the toughest
chance of them all. But up there, you still have one chance
in two: you may get hit, or you may not. If you breeze through
it, you'll be a better man for all the rest of your life. And if you
get hit, you still have one chance in two. You may get a
small wound, and become a hero to your family and friends.
Or there is always the last chance that it may take you out
altogether. And while that is a little rugged, it is at least worth
remembering that very few people seem to get out of this life
alive."</p>

<p>There was as simple an idea as any military instructor ever
unloaded, and yet troops cheered this man wherever he went.</p>

<p>Lt. Col. H. M. Hutchinson, of the British Army, already described
in this book as an instructor who made a powerful impression
on the American Army in World War I because of his
droll wit, was a master hand at taking the oblique approach to
teach a lesson. Old officers still remember the manner and the
moral of passages such as this one:</p>

<p>"On the march back from Mons&mdash;and I may say that a very
good army sometimes must retreat, though no doubt it wounds
the sensibilities to consider it&mdash;we did rather well. But I
noticed often the confusion caused by marching slowly up one
side of a hill and dashing down the other. It is a tendency of
all columns on foot.</p>

<p>"A captain is sitting out in front on a horse, with a hell of
a great pipe in his mouth and thinking of some girl in a cafe,
and of course he moves slowly up the hill. He comes to the
top and his pace quickens. Well, then, what happens? The
taller men are at the top of the column, and they lengthen their
stride&mdash;but what becomes of Nipper and Sandy down in
the twentieth squad? Half the time, you see, they are running
to catch up. So the effect is to jam the troops together on an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
upgrade and to stretch them out going down&mdash;you know&mdash;like
a concertina."</p>

<p>Where then is the beginning of efficiency in the art of instruction?
It resides in becoming diligent and disciplined about
self-instruction. No man can develop great power as an instructor,
or learn to talk interestingly and convincingly, until
he has begun to think deeply. And depth of thought does not
come of vigorous research on an assignment immediately at
hand, but from intensive collateral study throughout the course
of a career. We are all somewhat familiar with the type of
commander who, when asked: "What are your officers doing
about special studies, so that they may better their reading
habits and further their powers of self-expression?" will puff
himself up by replying, "They are kept so busily employed that
they have no time for any such exercise." This is one way of
saying that his subordinates are kept too busy to get essential
work done.</p>

<p>Research, on the spot and at the time, is vital and necessary
so that the presentation of any subject will be factually freshened
and documented. But its nature and object should not be
overrated. The real values can be compared to what happens
to a pitcher when he warms up before a game. This is merely
an act of suppling the muscles; the real conditioning process
has already taken place, and it has been long and arduous.</p>

<p>Even so is it with immediate research, in its relation to continuing
military study, in the perfecting of instructorship. That
which gives an officer power, and conviction, on the platform,
or before a group, is not the thing which he learned only
yesterday, having been compelled to read it in a manual or
other source, but the whole body of this thought and philosophy,
as it may be directed toward the invigorating of any
presentation of any subject. If he forms the habit of careful
reflection, then almost everything that he reads and hears
other people say that arouses his own interest becomes grist for

<p>Like 10 years in the penitentiary, it's easy to say but hard
to do. So much time, seemingly, has to be wasted in profitless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
study to find a few kernels amid much chaff. Napoleon said at
one point that the trouble with books is that one must read so
many bad ones to find something really good. True enough
but, even so, there are perfectly practical ways to advance
rapidly without undue waste motion. Consider this: Among
one's superiors there are always discriminating men who have
"adopted" a few good books after reading many bad ones.
When they say that a text is worthwhile, it deserves reading
and careful study.</p>

<p>The junior who starts building a working library for his professional
use cannot do better than to consult those older men
who are scholars as well as leaders, and ask them to name
five or six texts which have most stimulated their thought. It
comes as a surprising discovery that some of the titles which
are recommended with the greatest enthusiasm are not among
the so-called classics on war. The well-read man need not have
more than a dozen books in his home, provided that they all
count with him, and he continues to pore over them and to
ponder the weight of what is said. On the other hand, the ignorant
man is frequently marked by his bookshelf stocked with
titles, not one of which suggests that he has any professional
discernment.</p>

<p>The notebook habit is invaluable, nay, indispensable, to any
young officer who is ambitious to perfect himself as an instructor.
Most men who are distinguished for their thinking
ability are inveterate keepers of scrapbooks and of reference
files where they have put clippings and notes which jogged their
own thoughts. This is not a cheap device leading to the parroting
of other men; the truth is that the departure line toward
original thinking by any man is established by the mental energy
which he acquires by imaginative observation of other men's
ideas.</p>

<p>To get back to the notebook, it should be loose-leaf and
well-bound, else it is not likely to be given permanent use.
Whether it is kept at home or the office is immaterial. What
matters is that it be made a receptacle for everything that one
hears, reads or sees which may be of possible future value in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
preparation of classroom work. Books can't be clipped; but
short, decisive passages can be copied, and longer ones can be
made the subject of a reference item. Copying is one way of
fixing an idea in the memory. While on the subject of books,
it is all right to quote the classics and to be able to refer to the
great authorities on the science of war. But it is more effective
by far to read deeply into such writers as Clausewitz, Mahan
and Fuller, and to find some of their strongest but least-known
passages for one's self, than to rely on the more popular but
shop-worn quotations which are in general circulation. Such old
chestnuts as, "The moral is to the material as three to one,"
do not refresh discourse.</p>

<p>Even so, the classics are only one small field worth cultivating.
Nearly every major speech by current military leadership
contains a passage or two well worth salting away. The
writings of the philosophers, the publications of the industrial
world, the daily press and the scientific journals are goldmines
containing rich nuggets of information and of choice expression
worth study and preservation.</p>

<p>In fact, the military instructor has the whole world as his
workshop. His notebook should be as ready to receive some
especially apt saying by a new recruit as the more ponderous
words uttered by the sages. And it should contain, not less,
comments on techniques and methods used by other speakers
and instructors, which were visibly unusually effective.</p>

<p>Above all, the consistent use of obvious and stereotyped devices
and methods of presentation should be avoided. For the
fact is that <em>no one has yet discovered the one best way</em>. In our
service thinking, we tend to get into a rut, and to use none but
the well-tried way. For example, we overwork the twin principles
of thought-surprise and thought-concentration, and in the
effort to produce dramatic effect, we sometimes achieve only an
anticlimax. Using the techniques of the advertising world, the
military instructor puts his exhibits behind a screen, in order
to buildup anticipation, and at the appropriate moment he
yanks the cover off. This is perfectly effective, in some instances.
But it becomes a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> when he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
working with only one chart, or a pair or so of objects. Let's
say that he is talking about one machine gun, and he has one
chart highlighting its characteristics. How much more impressive
it would be if they were in the open at the beginning and he
were to start by saying: "Gentlemen, I am talking about this
one gun and what keeps it going. It is more important that you
see and know this gun from this moment than that you be
persuaded by what I am about to say!"</p>

<p>It is a very simple but inviolable rule that where there is
an obvious straining to produce an effect by the use of any
training aid, then the effect of the training aid is lost and the
speaker is proportionately enfeebled. A famous World War II
commander said of all operations: "It is the chaps, not the
charts, that get the job done."</p>

<p>What needs to be kept in mind is the psychological object in
their use. The scientists tell us, and we can partly take their
word for it, that people learn about 75 percent of what they
know through their sight, 13 percent through their hearing, and
12 percent through their other senses. But this is a relative
and qualitative, rather than an absolute, truth. It has to be so.
Otherwise, book study, which employs sight exclusively, would
be the only efficient method of teaching, and oral instruction,
which depends primarily on sound impact, would be a wasteful
process.</p>

<p>The more fundamental truth is that when oral instruction is
properly done, the mind becomes peculiarly receptive because
it is being bombarded by both sight and sound impressions.
Nor is this small miracle wrought primarily by what we call
training aids. The thoughts and ideas which remain most vivid
in the memory get their adhesive power because some particular
person said them in a graphic way in a pregnant moment.
Our working thoughts are more often the product of an association
with some other individual than not. We remember
words largely because we remember an occasion. We believe
in ideas because first we were impressed by the source whence
they came.</p>

<p>The total impression of a speaker&mdash;his sincerity, his knowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>edge,
his enthusiasm, his mien, and his gestures&mdash;is what
carries conviction and puts an indelible imprint on the memory.
Man not only thinks, but he moves, and he is impressed most
of all by animate objects. Vigorous words mean little or nothing
to him when they issue from a lack-luster personality.</p>

<p>Artificiality is one of the more serious faults, and it is unfortunately
the case that though an instructor may be solid
to the core, he will seem out of his element, unless he is careful
to avoid stilted words and vague or catch-all phrases and connectives.
Strength in discourse comes of simplicity.</p>

<p>But it has become almost an American disease of late that we
painfully avoid saying it straight. "We made contact, and upon
testing my reaction to him, found it distinctly adverse" is substituted
for "I met him and didn't like him." But what is equally
painful is to hear public remarks interlarded with such phrases
as "It would seem," "As I was saying," "And so, in closing,"
"Permit me to call your attention to the fact" and "Let us reflect
briefly"&mdash;which is often the prelude to a 2-hour harangue.</p>

<p>Not less out of place in public address is the apologetic note.
The man who starts by explaining that he's unaccustomed to
public speaking, or badly prepared, is simply asking for the
hook. "To explain what I mean" or "to make myself clear"
makes the audience wonder only why he didn't say it that way
in the first place. But the really low man on this totem pole is
the one who says, "Perhaps you're not getting anything out of
this."</p>

<p>A man does not have to go off like a gatling gun merely because
he is facing the crowd. Mr. Churchill, one of the great
orators of the century, made good use of deliberate and frequent
pauses. It is a trick worth any young speaker's cultivation,
enabling the collection of thought and the avoiding of
tiresome "and ah-h-h's."</p>

<p>Likewise, because a man is in military uniform does not require
that his speech be terse, cold, given to the biting of words
and the overemployment of professional jargon. Training instruction
is not drill. Its efficiency does not come of its in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>cisiveness
but of the bond of sympathy which comes to prevail
between the instructor and his followers.</p>

<p>Another main point: It is disconcerting to talk about the
ABCs, if the group already knows the alphabet. To devote any
great part of a presentation to matters which the majority
present already well understand is to assure that the main
object will receive very little serious attention. Thus in talking
about the school of the rifle, only a fool would start by explaining
what part of it was the trigger and from which end
the bullet emerged, though it might be profitable to devote a
full hour to the discussion of caliber. Likewise, in such a field
as tactical discussion, the minds of men are more likely to be
won, and their imagination stirred, through giving them the
reasoning behind a technique or method than by telling them
simply how a thing is done.</p>

<p>In talk, as in tactics, at the beginning the policy of the
limited objective is a boon to confidence. It scares any green
man to think about talking for an hour. But if he starts with a
subject of his own choice and to his liking, and works up to
15-minute talk for a group of platoon size, he will quickly
develop his powers over the short course; the switch from
sprinting to distance running can be made gradually and without
strain. But it's easy that does it, and one step at a time.</p>

<p>Excessive modesty is unbecoming. No matter how firm his
sources, or complex the subject, any instructor should form the
habit of adding a few thoughts of his own to any presentation.
It is not a mark of precocity but of interest when an instructor
knows his material, and its application to the human element,
sufficiently well to express an occasional personal opinion. Since
he is not a phonograph record, he has a right to say, "I think"
or "I believe." Indeed, if he does not have his subject sufficiently
in hand that it has stirred his own imagination, he is
no better than a machine.</p>

<p>That leads to a discussion of outlines. They are necessary, if
any subject is to be covered comprehensively. But if they are
overelaborated, the whole performance becomes automatic and
dull. A little spontaneity is always needed. Even when working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
from a manuscript, a speaker should be ever-ready to depart
from his text if a sudden idea pops into his mind. It is better
to try this and to stumble now and then than to permit the
mind to be commanded by words written on paper.</p>

<p>Likewise, revision of outline between talks is the way of the
alert mind. A man cannot do this work without seeing, in the
midst of discussion, points which need strengthening, and bets
which have been missed. Notes should be revised as soon as
the period is completed.</p>

<p>There are many methods of instruction, among them being
the seminar, critique, group discussion and conference. They
are not described here for the reason that every young officer
quickly learns about them in the schools, and gets to know
the circumstances under which one form or another can be used
to greatest advantage.</p>

<p>It suffices to say that their common denominator, insofar as
personal success and ease of participation are concerned, is the
ability to think quickly and accurately on one's feet; the one
best school for the sharpening of this faculty is the lecture
platform. Keenness is a derivative of pressure.</p>

<p>Use of a wire recorder or a platter, so that one can get a
playback after talking, is an aid to self-criticism. But it is not
enough. A man will often miss his own worst faults, because
they came of ignorance in the first place; too, voice reproduction
proves nothing about the effectiveness of one's presence,
expression and gesture. It is common-sense professional procedure
to ask the views of one or two of the more experienced
members of the audience as to how the show went over, and
what were its weak points.</p>

<p>There is one hidden danger in becoming too good at this
business. Too frequently, polished speakers fall in love with the
sound of their own voices, and want to be heard to the exclusion
of everyone else. In the military establishment, where
the ideal object is to get 100 percent participation from all
personnel, this is a more serious vice than snoring in a pup tent.</p>

<p>When an officer feels any temptation to monopolize the discussion,
it is time to pray for a bad case of bronchitis.</p>

YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR MEN</h3>


<p>Inasmuch as most of this book has been directed toward
covering the various approaches to this subject, there is need to
discuss here only a relatively few points which could not conveniently
be treated elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is the touchstone of success.</p>

<p>To any officer starting on a life career, it is impossible to
overstate its importance. For the moment, we can forget the
words duty and responsibility. The question is: "How do I get
ahead?" And for a junior there is one main road open&mdash;he
will strive to achieve such a communion of spirit with his
subordinates that he will know the personality and character of
every one of his men, will understand what moves and what
stops them, and will be sympathetic to their every impulse.</p>

<p>This is the main course. The great principles of war have
evolved from centuries of observation on how men react in the
mass. It could not be otherwise than that any officer's growth
in knowledge of when and how these principles apply to varying
situations, strategical and tactical, come primarily of the
acuteness of his powers of observation of individual men, and of
men working together in groups, and responding to their leadership,
under widely different conditions of stress, strain and
emotion.</p>

<p>The roots of this kind of wisdom are not to be acquired
from book study; books are a help only as they provide an index
to what should be sought. The sage who defined strategy as
"the art of the possible" (the art of politics has been defined in
the same words) wrote better than he knew. The cornerstone
of the science of war is knowledge of the economy of men's
powers, of their physical possibilities and limitations, of their
response to fatigue, hope, fear, success and discouragement,
and of the weight of the moral factor in everything they do.
Man is a beast of burden; he will fail utterly in the crisis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of battle if there is no respect for his aching back. He is also
one of a great brotherhood whose mighty fellowship can make
the worst misery tolerable, and can provide him with undreamed
strength and courage. These are among the things that
need to be studied and understood; they are the main score.
It is only when an officer can stand and say that he is first of
all a student of human material that all of the technical and
material aspects of war begin to conform toward each other and
to blend into an orderly pattern. And the laboratory is right
outside the office door. Either an officer grows up with, and
into, this kind of knowledge through reflecting on everything
that he can learn of men wherever he fits himself into a new
environment, or because of having neglected to look at trees,
he will also miss the forest.</p>

<p>By the numbers, it isn't a difficult assignment. The schools
have found by experiment that the average officer can learn
the names of 50 men in between 7 and 10 days. If he is in daily
contact with men, he should know 125 of them by name and
by sight within 1 month. Except under war conditions, he is
not likely to work with larger numbers than that.</p>

<p>This is the only way to make an intelligent start. So long as a
man is just a number, or a face, to his officer, there can be no
deep trust between them. Any man loves to hear the sound of
his own name, and when his superior doesn't know it, he feels
like a cypher.</p>

<p>As with any other introduction, an officer meeting an enlisted
man for the first time is not privileged to be inquisitive about
his private affairs. In fact, nosiness and prying are unbecoming
at any time, and in no one more than in a military officer.
On the other hand, any man is flattered if he is asked about
his work or his family, and the average enlisted man will feel
complimented if an officer engages him in small talk of any
kind. Greater frankness, covering a wide variety of subjects,
develops out of longer acquaintance. It should develop as
naturally and as easily as in civilian walks of life; rank is no
barrier to it unless the officer is overimpressed with himself
and bent on keeping the upper hand; the ranks are wiser about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
these things than most young officers; they do not act forward
or presumptuous simply because they see an officer talking and
acting like a human being. But they aren't Quiz Kids. Informal
conversation between officer and man is a two-way street. The
ball has to be batted back and forth across the net or there isn't
any game. An officer has to extend himself, his thoughts, his
experiences and his affairs into the conversation, or after his
first trial or two, there will be nothing coming back.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately the case that many young officers assume
that getting acquainted with their men is a kind of interrogation
process, like handling an immigrant knocking for admission
to the United States. They want to know everything, but
they stand on what they think is their right to tell a man
nothing. That kind of attitude just doesn't wash. In fact, the
chief value of such conversations is that it permits the junior
to see his superior as a man rather than as a boss.</p>

<p>An officer should never speak ironically or sarcastically to an
enlisted man, since the latter doesn't have a fair chance to
answer back. The use of profanity and epithets comes under
the same heading. The best argument for a man keeping his
temper is that nobody else wants it; and when he voluntarily
throws it away, he loses a main prop to his own position.</p>

<p>Meeting one of his own enlisted men in a public place, the
officer who does not greet him personally and warmly, in addition
to observing the formal courtesies between men in service,
has sacrificed a main chance to win the man's abiding esteem.
If the man is with his family, a little extra graciousness will go
a long way, and even if it didn't, it would be the right thing.</p>

<p>In any informal dealing with a number of one's own men, it
is good judgment to pay a little additional attention to the
youngest or greenest member of the group, instead of permitting
him to be shaded by older and more experienced men. They
will not resent it, and his confidence will be helped.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that an officer does not drink
with his men, though if he is a guest of honor at an organizational
party where punch or liquor is being served, it would
be a boorish act for him to decline a glass, simply because of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
proscription. Sometimes in a public cocktail bar an officer will
have the puzzling experience of being approached by a strange
but lonely enlisted man who, being a little high, may have got
it into his head that it is very important to buy an officer a drink.
What one does about that depends upon all of the surrounding
circumstances. It is better to go through with it than create a
scene which will give everyone a low opinion of the service.
Irrespective of rules, there are always situations which are resolved
only by good judgment. And, of course, the problem can
be avoided by staying away from cocktail bars.</p>

<p>Visiting men in hospital is a duty which no officer should
neglect. Not only does it please the man and his family; it is
one of the few wide open portals to a close friendship with
him. It is strange but true that the man never forgets the officer
who was thoughtful enough to call on him when he was down.
And the effect of it goes far beyond the man himself. Other
men in the unit are told about it. Other patients in the ward
see it and note with satisfaction that the corps takes its responsibilities
to heart. If the man is in such shape that he can't write
a letter, it is a worthy act to serve him in this detail. By the
same token when a man goes on sick call, the officer's responsibility
does not end at the point where the doctor takes over.
His interest is to see that the man is made well, and if he has
reason to think that the treatment he is receiving falls short
of the best possible, it is within his charge to raise the question.
The old saw about giving the man CC pills and iodine and
marking him duty is now considerably outdated. But it is not
assumed that every member of the medical staff serving the
forces will at all times do his duty with the intelligence and
reverence of a saint.</p>

<p>A birthday is a big day in any man's life. So is his wedding.
So is the birth of a child. By making check of the roster and
records, and by keeping an ear to the ground for news of what
is happening in the unit, an officer can follow these events.
Calling the man in and giving him a handclasp and word of
congratulation, or writing a note to the home, takes very little
time and is worth every moment of it. Likewise, if he has won<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
some distinction, such as earning a promotion, a letter of appreciation
to his parents or his wife will compound the value of
telling the man himself that you are proud of what he has done.</p>

<p>Nothing is more pleasing or ingratiating to any junior than
to be asked by his superior for his opinion on any matter&mdash;provided
that it is given a respectful hearing. Any man gets a
little fagged from being <em>told</em> all the time. When he is consulted
and asked for a judgment, it builds him up.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no point in visiting kitchens or quarters
and asking of the atmosphere if everything is all right. Men
seldom complain, and they are loath to stick their necks out
when there are other enlisted men within hearing. It is the task
of the officer to <em>see</em> that all is right, and to take whatever
trouble is necessary to make certain. If he is doubtful about the
mess, then a mere pecky sampling of it will do no good. Either
he will live with it for a few meals, or he won't find the "bugs"
in it.</p>

<p>An officer should not ask a man: "Would you like to do such-and-such
a task?" when he has already made up his mind to
assign him to a certain line of duty. Orders, hesitatingly given,
are doubtfully received. But the right way to do it is to instill
the idea of collaboration. There is something irresistably appealing
about such an approach as: "I need your help. Here's what
we have to do."</p>

<p>An officer is not expected to appear all-wise to those who
serve under him. Bluffing one's way through a question when
ignorant of the answer is foolhardy business. "I'm sorry, but I
don't know," is just as appropriate from an officer's lips as from
any other. And it helps more than a little to be able to add,
"But I'll find out."</p>

<p>Rank should be used to serve one's subordinates. It should
never be flaunted or used to get the upper hand of a subordinate
in any situation save where he had already discredited himself
in an unusually ugly or unseemly manner.</p>

<p>When suggestions from any subordinate are adopted, the
credit should be passed on to him publicly.</p>

<p>When a subordinate has made a mistake, but not from any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
lack of good will, it is common sense to take the rap for him
rather than make him suffer doubly for his error.</p>

<p>An officer should not issue orders which he cannot enforce.</p>

<p>He should be as good as his word, at all times and in any
circumstance.</p>

<p>He should promise nothing which he cannot make stick.</p>

<p>An officer should not work, looking over his men's shoulder,
checking on every detail of what they are doing, and calling
them to account at every furlong post. This maidenly attitude
corrodes confidence and destroys initiative.</p>

<p>On the other hand, contact is necessary at all times. Particularly
when men are doing long-term work, or are operating in
detachment at a remote point, they will become discouraged
and will lose their sense of direction unless their superior looks
in on them periodically, asks whether he can be of any help,
and, so doing, gets them to open up and discuss the problem.</p>

<p>The Navy says, "It isn't courtesy to change the set of the sail
within 30 minutes after relief of the watch." Applied to a
command job, this means that it is a mistake for an officer, on
taking a new post, to order sweeping changes affecting other
men, in the belief that this will give him a reputation for action
and firmness. The studying of the situation is the overture to
the steadying of it. The story is told of Gen. Curtis E. LeMay of
the Air Force. Taking over the 21st Bomber Command in the
Marianas, he faced the worried staff officers of his predecessor
and said quietly, "You're all staying put. I assume you know
your jobs or you wouldn't be here."</p>

<p>The identity of the officer with the gentleman should persist
in his relations with men of all degree. In the routine of daily
direction and disposition, and even in moments of exhortation,
he had best bring courtesy to firmness. The finest officers that
one has known are not occasional gentlemen, but in every circumstance:
in commissioned company and, more importantly,
in contact with those who have no recourse against arrogance.</p>

<p>The traditional wisdom of addressing Judy O'Grady with the
same politeness as one would the Colonel's Lady applies equally
in all situations in life where one is at arbitrary advantage in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
dealing with another. To press this unnecessarily is to sacrifice
something of one's quality in the eyes of the onlooker. Besides,
there is always the better way.</p>

YOUR MEN'S MORAL AND PHYSICAL WELFARE</h3>


<p>To put it in a nutshell, the moral of this chapter is that
when men are moral, the moral power which binds them together
and fits them for high action is given its main chance
for success.</p>

<p>There should therefore be no confusion about how the word
is being used. We are speaking both of training in morals for
every day living, and of moral training which will harden the
will of a fighting body. One moment's reflection will show why
they need not be considered separately, and why we can leave
it to Webster to do the hairsplitting.</p>

<p>It is the doctrine of the armed establishment of the United
States that when American men lead a personal life which is
based on high moral standards, and when their aim is equally
high as to physical fitness and toughness, under training conditions
they will mature those qualities which are most likely
to produce inspired leading and stout following within the
forces.</p>

<p>There is nothing panty-waist about this doctrine. It was not
pronounced to gratify the clergy or to reassure parents that
their sons would be in good hands, even though these things,
too, are important.</p>

<p>The doctrine came of the experience of the Nation in war,
and of what the services learned by measuring their own men.
But it happened, also, that the facts were consistent with a
common sense reckoning of the case.</p>

<p>Let's figure it out. To be temperate in all things, to be
continent, and to refrain from loose living of any sort, are acts
of the will. They require self-denial, and a foregoing of that
which may be more attractive, in favor of the thing which
should be done. Granted that there are a few individuals who
are so thin-blooded that they never feel tempted to digress
morally, men in the majority are not like that. What they re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>nounce
in the name of self-discipline, at the cost of a considerable
inner stress, they endeavour to compensate by their gains in
personal character. Making that grade isn't easy; but no one
who is anyone has yet said that it isn't worthwhile. In the armed
services there is an old saying that an officer without character
is more useless than a ship with no bottom.</p>

<p>In the summing up, the strength of will which enables a
man to lead a clean life is no different than the strength of
purpose which fits him to follow a hard line of duty. There are
exceptions to every rule. Many a lovable rounder has proved
himself to be a first-class fighting man. But even though he had
an unconquerable weakness for drink and women, his resolution
had to become steeled along some other line or he would
have been no good when the pay-off came.</p>

<p>Putting aside for the moment the question of the vices, and
regarding only the gain to moral power which comes of bodily
exercise and physical conditioning, it should be self-evident that
the process which builds the muscle must also train and alert
the mind. How could it be otherwise? Every physical act must
have as its origin a mental impulse, conscious or unconscious.
Thus in training a man to master his muscles we also help
him to master his brain. He comes out of physical training not
only better conditioned to move but better prepared to think
about how and why he is moving, which is true mobility.</p>

<p>In military organizations, "setting-up" and other formation
exercises are usually a drag and a bore. Men grumble about
them, and even after they are toughened to them, so that they
feel no physical distress, they rarely relish them. The typical
American male would much rather sit on his pants along the
sidelines and watch someone else engage in contact sports. It's
almost the national habit. Despite our athletic prowess, about 56
percent of American males grow to manhood without having
ever participated in a group game.</p>

<p>But no matter how great the inertia against it, there must be
unremitting perseverance in the physical conditioning of military
forces. For finally, it is killing men with kindness to relax
at this point. If life is to be conserved, if men are to be given a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
fair chance to play their parts effectively, the physical standards
during training cannot be less than will give them a maximum
fitness for the extraordinary stresses of campaigning in war.</p>

<p>When troops lack the coordinated response which comes of
long, varied and rigorous exercises, their combat losses will be
excessive, they will lack cohesion in their action against the
enemy, and they will uselessly expend much of their initial
velocity. In the United States service, we are tending to forget,
because of the effect of motorization, that the higher value of
the discipline of the road march in other days wasn't that it
hardened the muscles, but that, short of combat, it was the
best method of separating the men from the boys. This is true
today, despite all of the new conditions imposed by technological
changes. A hard road march is the most satisfactory training
test of the moral strength of the individual man.</p>

<p>At the same time, to senselessly overload men for road marching
hurts them two ways. It weakens their faith in the sense of
the command, thereby impairing morale, and it breaks down
their muscle and tendon. Enough is known about the average
American male to provide a basic logistical figure. He stands
about 5 feet 8 inches, and weighs about 153 pounds. The
optimum load for a man is about one-third of body weight,
the same as for a mule. That means that for a training march,
approximately 50 pounds over-all, including uniform, blankets
and everything, is the most that a man should be required to
carry. If he gets so that he can handle that load easily, over let
us say a 10-mile road march, then the thing to do, further to
build up his power, is not to increase the weight that he
carries, but to lengthen the march. Military men have known
that this is the underlying principle for better than half a
century. But the principle has not always been observed.</p>

<p>There is another not infrequent cause of breakdown&mdash;the
leader who makes the mistake of thinking that every man's
limit is the same as his own. Some come into the officer corps
fresh from the stadia and cinderpaths of the colleges, in the
pink of condition. They take charge of a group of men, some
not yet seasoned, and others somewhat older and more wind-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>broke
than themselves. They shag them all over the lot at
reveille or take them on a cross-country chase like a smart
rabbit trying to outrun hounds. The poor devils ultimately get
back, some with their corks completely pulled, a few feeling too
nauseated to eat their breakfast, and others walking in, feeling
whipped because they couldn't keep up with the group.</p>

<p>When an officer does this kind of thing thoughtlessly, he
shows himself to be an incompetent observer of men. When he
does it to show off, he deserves to be given 10 days in the
electric chair.</p>

<p><em>It is the steadiness and the continuity of exercise, not the
working of men to the point of exhaustion and collapse, which
keeps them upgrading until they are conditioned to the strain of
whatever comes.</em> To do it the other way around simply makes
them hospital patients before their time, and fills them with
resentment against the service.</p>

<p>In the nature of things, the officer who has been an athlete
can fit himself into this part of the program with little difficulty
and with great credit, provided he acts with the moderation that
is here suggested. The armed services put great store by this.
A man with a strong flair for physical training can usually
find a good berth.</p>

<p>By the same token, the officer who has shunned sports in
school, either because he didn't have the size or the coordination,
or was more interested in something else, will frequently
have an understandable hesitation about trying to play a lead
hand in anything which he thinks will make him look bad. Of
this comes much buck-passing. There is often a singular courtesy
between officers within a unit, and they'll switch details, just
to be friendly. So it frequently happens that the man who has
no great knack at leading in exercise and recreation gets the
mouse's share of it. And thereby the whole point is missed. For
it should be perfectly clear that the man who has had the least
active experience in this field is usually the one in greatest need
of its strengthening effects. His case is no different than that of
the enlisted man. If he has not kept himself in good physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
shape, his nerves will not be able to stand the strain of combat,
to say nothing of his legs.</p>

<p>It can be said again and again: <em>The highest form of physical
training that an officer can undergo is the physical conditioning
of his own men.</em> Nothing else can give him more faith in
his own ability to stay the course and nothing else is likely to
give him a firmer feeling of solidarity with his men. Study, and
an active thirst for wider professional knowledge, have their
place in an officer's scheme of things. But there is something
about the experience of bodily competition, of joining with,
and leading men in strenuous physical exercise, which uniquely
invigorates one's spirit with the confidence: "I can do this! I
can lead! I can command!" Military men have recognized this
since long before it was said that Waterloo was won on the
playing fields of Eton. Bringing it down to the present, Gen.
Sir Archibald Wavell said: "The civil comparison to war must
be that of a game, a very rough and dirty game, for which a
robust body and mind are essential." Even more emphatic are
the words of Coach Frank Leahy of Notre Dame, an officer of
the United States Navy in World War II: "The ability to rise
up and grasp an opportunity is something that a boy cannot
learn in lecture rooms or from textbooks. It is on the athletic
field primarily that Americans acquire the winning ways that
play such an important part in the American way of life. The
burning desire to emerge the victor that we see in our contact
sports is the identical spirit that gave the United States Marines
victory at Iwo Jima. If we again know war, the boys who have
received sound training in competitive athletics will again fight
until the enemy has had enough."</p>

<p>Men like to see their officers competing and "giving it a
good college try" no matter how inept, or clumsy they may
be. But they take a pretty dim view of the leader who perennially
acts as if he were afraid of a sweat or a broken thumb. In
team sports, developing around interorganized rivalry, the
eligibility of an officer to participate among enlisted men is a
matter of local ground rules, or special regulations. There is
nothing in the customs of the services which prohibit it. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the contrary, it has been done many times, and is considered
to be altogether within an officer's dignity. Where there is a
flat ruling against it, it is usually on the theory that the officer,
by competing, is robbing some enlisted man of his chance.</p>

<p>Need it be said that in any event, going along with the team,
and taking an active interest in its ups-and-downs, is not only
a service officer's duty, but a rewarding privilege, if he is a real
leader? In this respect, he has a singular relationship to any
group that represents his unit. He becomes part of their force,
and his presence is important not only to the team but to the
gallery. It is not unusual to hear very senior officers excuse
themselves from an important social function by saying, "I'm
sorry, but my team is playing tonight." That is a reason which
everybody understands and accepts.</p>

<p>As for the ranks, even among those men who have had no
prior acquaintance with organized sports, there is a marked
willingness to participate, if given just a little encouragement.
This is one of the effects of getting into military uniform. As
someone said about gunpowder, "it makes all men alike tall,"
and provides a welcome release from former inhibitions. The
military company is much more tightly closed than any other.
When men are thinking and working together in a binding association,
they will seek an outlet for their excess spirits, and will
join together in play, even under the most adverse circumstance.
During World War I, it was common to see American troops
playing such games as duck-on-the-rock, tag and touch football
with somebody's helmet in close proximity to the front.
Because no other equipment was available, they improvised.
So it is that in any situation, the acme in leadership consists,
not in screaming one's head off about shortages, but in using
a little imagination about what can be done.</p>

<p>The really good thing about the gain in moral force deriving
from all forms of physical training is that it is an unconscious
gain. Will power, determination, mental poise and muscle control
all march hand-in-hand with the general health and well-being
of the man, with results not less decisive under training
conditions than on the field of battle. A man who develops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
correct posture and begins to fill out his body so that he looks
the part of a fighter will take greater pride in the wearing of
the uniform. So doing, he will take greater care so to conduct
himself morally that he will not disgrace it. He will gain confidence
as he acquires a confident and determined bearing. This
same presence, and the physical strength which contributes to
it, will help carry him through the hour of danger. Strength of
will is partly of the mind and partly of the body. In combat,
fatigue will beat men down as quickly as any other condition,
for fatigue inevitably carries fear with it. Tired men are men
afraid. There is no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it
on the road for lack of preliminary hardening in troops. Such
a condition cannot be redeemed by the resolve of a commander
who insists on driving troops an extra mile beyond their general
level of physical endurance. Extremes of this sort make men
rebellious and hateful of the command, and thus strike at
tactical efficiency from two directions at once. For when men
resent a commander, they will not fight as willingly for him,
and when their bodies are spent, their nerves are gone.</p>

<p>Looking after the welfare of men, however, does not connote
simply getting them into the open air and giving them a chance
to kick the ball around. The services are pretty well organized
to provide their personnel with adequate sport and recreational
facilities, and to insure an active, balanced program, in any
save the most exceptional circumstance. Too, the provisions
made for the creature comforts of men are ample, experience-tested,
and well-regulated.</p>

<p>It is not so much that a young officer needs to have book
instruction about the detail of these things. Such is the system
that they can hardly escape his notice, any more than he can
escape knowing where to get his pay check and by which path
he goes to the barbershop.</p>

<p>What counts mainly is that he should fully understand the
prime importance of a personal caring for his men, so that
they cannot fail of a better life if it is within his power and
wisdom to lead them to it.</p>

<p>Once the principle is grasped, and accepted without any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
mental reservation, time and experience will educate him in
the countless meetings of situations which require its application.</p>

<p>There are times and situations which require that all men be
treated identically, for the good of organization. There are also
occasions when nothing else suffices but to give the most help,
the most encouragement, the most relief to those who are most
greatly in need. Grown men understand that, and the officer,
approaching every situation with the question in his mind:
"What does reason say about what constitutes fair play in this
condition?" cannot go far wrong in administering to the welfare
of those who serve under him.</p>

<p><em>It is moral courage, combined with practice, which builds in
one a delicate sense of the eternal fitness of things.</em></p>

<p>One example: Under normal training conditions, it would be
fair play, and the acceptable thing, to rotate men and their
junior leaders to such an onerous task as guard duty. But if a
unit was "dead beat" after a hard march, and an officer, pursuing
his line of duty, walked among his men, inspecting their
blistered feet and doing all he could to ease each man's physical
discomfort, he would then be using excessively poor judgment
if he did not pick out the men most physically fit to do whatever
additional duty was required that night.</p>

<p>But infinite painstaking in attending to the physical welfare
of men is not more important than thoughtful attention to their
spiritual wants, and their moral needs. In fact, if we would give
a little more priority to the latter, the former would be far more
likely to come along all right.</p>

<p>The average American enlisted man is quite young when he
enters service, and because he is young, he is impressionable.
What his senior tells him becomes a substitute for the influence
and teaching that he shed when he left his home or school.
That need not mean a senior in age! <em>He looks to his officer,
even though the latter may be junior in years, because he believes
that the man with rank is a little wiser, and he has faith
that he will not be steered wrong.</em></p>

<p>Despite all the publicity given to VD, American kids don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
know a great deal about its reality, and even though the greater
number of them like to talk about women, what they have to
say rarely reveals them as worldly-wise.</p>

<p>If an officer talks straight on these subjects, and believes in
what he says sufficiently to set the good example, he can convince
his better men that the game isn't worth the candle,
and can save even some of the more reckless spirits from a
major derail.</p>

KEEPING YOUR MEN INFORMED</h3>


<p>Nobody ever told the South Sea savage about the nature of
air in motion. He had never heard of wind and therefore could
not imagine its effects. Thus when he heard strange noises in
the treetops and there was a howling around certain headlands,
while other headlands were silent, he could believe only that
the spirits were at work. He would strain his ear to hear what
they had to say to him, and never being able to understand,
he would become all the more fearful.</p>

<p>It all sounds pretty silly. And yet civilization is a great deal
like that. We pride ourselves today in saying, particularly within
the western nations, that men and women are better informed
than ever before in the history of the world. What we
really mean by that is that they are overburdened with more
kinds of fragmentary information than any people of the past.
They know just enough about many major questions of the
day that either they are driven to the making of fearful guesses
about the unknown, or they try to close their minds to the
subject, vainly seeking consolation in the half-truth, "What I
don't know can't hurt me."</p>

<p>Therein lies a great part of the problem. For it is a fair
statement that if all of the mystery could be stripped from such
a complex topic as the nature of atomic power, so that men
everywhere would understand it, universal fear would be displaced
by universal confidence that something could be done,
and society would be well along the road toward its control.</p>

<p>In World War I, the men who had the least fear of the
effects of gas warfare were the gas officers who understood their
subject right down to the last detail of the decontamination
process and the formula for dichlorethylsulphide (mustard gas).
The man to whom the dangers of submarine warfare seem
least fearsome is the submariner. Of all hands along the battle
line, the first aid man has the greatest calm and confidence in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the face of fire, largely because he has seen the miracles worked
by modern medicine in the restoring of grievously wounded
men. The general or the admiral who is most familiar with the
mettle of his subordinate commands will also have the most relaxed
mind under battle pressure.</p>

<p>This leads to a point, which it is better to state here than
anywhere else. In all military instruction pertaining to the
weapons and techniques of war, the basis of sound indoctrination
is the teaching that weapons when rightly used will invariably
produce victory, and preventive measures, when
promptly and thoroughly taken, will invariably conserve the
operational integrity of the defense. It is wrong, <em>dead wrong</em>, to
start, or carry along, on the opposite track, and try to persuade
men to do the right thing, by dwelling on the awful consequence
of doing the wrong thing. Confidence, not fear, is the keynote
of a strong and convictive doctrine.</p>

<p>In war, in the absence of information, man's natural promptings
alternate between unreasoning fears that the worst is likely
to happen, and the wishful thought that all danger is remote.
Either impulse is a barrier to the growth of that condition of
alert confidence which comes to men when they have a realization
of their own strength and a reasonably clear concept of the
general situation.</p>

<p>Man is a peculiar animal. He is no more prone to think about
himself as the central figure amid general disaster than he is to
dwell morbidly upon thoughts of his own death. Left in the
dark, he will get a certain comfort out of that darkness, at the
same time that it clouds his mind and freezes his action. Disturbed
by bad dreams about what might happen, he nonetheless
will not plan an effective use of his own resources against
that which is very likely to happen. Only when he is given a
clear view of the horizon, and is made animated by the general
purpose in all that moves around him, does he understand the
direction in which he should march, and taking hold, begin to
do the required thing.</p>

<p>It is almost gratuitous that this even needs to be stated. No
high commander would think of moving deliberately into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
fog of war if he was without knowledge of either the enemy
or friendly situation. Even to imagine such a contingency is
paralyzing. But in their nervous and spiritual substance, admirals
and generals are no different than the green men who
have come most recently to their forces. Such men can not
stand alone any more than can the recruit. They draw their
moral strength and their ability to contend intelligently against
adverse circumstance largely from what is told them by the men
who surround them. That is why they have their staffs. They
could not command even themselves if they were deprived of
all information.</p>

<p>Toward the assuring of competent, collected action, the first
great step is to remove the mystery. This is a process which
must be mastered in peacetime, if it is to stand the multiplied
strains of war. What mystery? Let it be said that it surrounds
the average file on every hand, even though the average junior
officer does not realize it, while at the same time he himself is
completely mystified by much that transpires above him. For
example, we all like to throw big words about, to air our professional
erudition; and we do not understand that to the man
who does not know their meaning, the effect is a blackout
which makes even the simplest object seem formidable. To illustrate,
we can take the word "bivouac," common enough in
military parlance, but rare in civilian speech. When green men
are told, "We are going into bivouac," and they are not sufficiently
grounded in the service to know that this means simply
going into camp for the night without shelter, their instinctive
first thought is, "This is another complex military process that
will probably catch me short." Similarly if told that they are
detailed "on a reconnaissance mission along the line of communications
with a liaison function," they could not fail to be
"flummoxed." And if then instructed to take a BAR up to the
MLR and follow SOP in covering a simulated SFC party, they
wouldn't be far from justified if they blew their tops, and ran
shrieking from the place.</p>

<p>These are horrible examples, put forward only to illuminate
a fairly simple point. Exaggerated though they may be, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>thing
of the same sort happens in almost every installation
nearly every day. The difference is only in degree. <em>Every man
in the service has an inalienable right to work and to think
in the clear.</em> He is entitled to the why and the wherefore of
whatever he is expected to do, as well as the what and the
how. His efficiency, his confidence and his enthusiasm will wax
strong in almost the precise measure that his superior imparts
to him everything he knows about a duty which can be of
possible benefit to the man. Furthermore, this is a two-way current.
Any officer who believes in the importance of giving
full information in a straight-forward manner, and continues
to act on that principle, will over the long run get back more
than he gives. But the chump who incontinently brushes off his
subordinates because he thinks his time is too valuable to spend
any great part of it putting them on the right track dooms
himself to work in a vacuum. He is soon spotted for what he is,
and if his superiors can't set him straight, they will shrug him
aside.</p>

<p>These are pretty much twentieth century concepts of how
force is articulated from top to bottom of a chain of command.
Yet the ideas are as old as the ages. Ecclesiastes is filled with
phrases pointing up that clarification is the way of strength
and of unity. "All go unto one place." "Two are better than
one." "Woe to him that is alone when he falleth." "A threefold
cord is not quickly broken." "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to
do, do it with thy might." "Folly is set in great dignity." "Truly
the light is sweet." Great commanders of the past have reflected
that knowledge is the source of the simplifying and
joining of all action and have pondered how better to resolve
the problem. But it is only in our time that this great principle
in military doctrine has become rooted deep enough to stay,
because the technological complexity of modern war is such as
to permit of no other course.</p>

<p>It is folly to attempt to oversimplify that which is of its
nature complex. War cannot be made less intricate by conjuring
everyone to return to kindergarten and henceforth use
only one-syllable words. No such counsel is here intended. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
one thought worth keeping is that the military system, as we
know it, will prove far more workable, and its members will
each become a stronger link in the chain of force, if all hands
work a little more carefully toward the growth of a common
awareness of all terminology, all process and all purpose.</p>

<p>Once pronounced, the object also requires to be seen in due
proportion. The principle does not entail that a corporal must
perforce know everything about operation of a company which
concerns his captain, to be happy and efficient in his own job.
But it does set forth that he is entitled to have all information
which relates to his personal situation, his prospects and his
action which it is within his captain's power to give him. A
coxswain is not interchangeable with a fleet admiral. To "bigot"
him (make available complete detail of a total plan) on an
operation would perhaps produce no better or worse effect than
a slight headache. But if he is at sea&mdash;in both senses of that
term&mdash;with no knowledge of where he is going or of his
chances of pulling through, and having been told of what will
be expected of him personally at the target, still has no picture
of the support which will be grouped around him, he is apt to
be as thoroughly miserable and demoralized as were the sailors
under Columbus, when sailing on and on, they came to fear
that they would override the horizon and go tumbling into
space.</p>

<p>Lt. Gen. Sir Frederick Morgan wrote of the policy applied at
his COSSAC planning headquarters during World War II:
"Right down to the cook, they were told what had happened,
what was happening, along with their part in it, and what it
was proposed to do next."</p>

<p>Paraphrasing Montaigne, President Roosevelt told the American
people during a great national crisis that the main thing
they need fear was fear itself. In matters great and small, the
fears of men arise chiefly from those matters they have not been
given to understand. Fear can be checked, whipped and driven
from the field when men are kept informed.</p>

<p>The dynamics of the information principle lies in this simple
truth. We look at the object through the wrong end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
telescope when in the military service we think of information
only as instruction in the cause of country, the virtues of the
free society and the record of our arms, in the hope that we
will make strong converts. These are among the things that
every American needs to know, but of themselves they will not
turn an average American male into an intelligent, aggressive
fighter. Invigorated action is the product of the free and well-informed
mind. The "will to do" comes of the confidence that
one's knowledge of what requires doing is equal to that of any
other man present.</p>

<p>This is the controlling idea and all constructive planning
and work in the field of information is shaped around it.</p>

COUNSELING YOUR MEN</h3>


<p>Among the ever-pressing problems of the commander, and
equally of the young officer schooling himself to the ways of
the service, is the seeking of means to break down the natural
timidity and reticence of the great majority of men.</p>

<p>This he can never do unless he is sufficient master of himself
that he can come out of his own shell and give his men a chance
to understand him as a human being rather than as an autocrat
giving orders. Nothing more unfortunate can happen to an
officer than to come to be regarded by his subordinates as unapproachable,
for such a reputation isolates him from the main
problems of command responsibility as well as its chief rewards.
So holding himself, he will never be able to see his forces in
their true light, and will either have to exercise snap judgment
upon the main problems within his own sphere, or take the
word of others as to the factors on which promotions, rewards
and punishments are based within the unit.</p>

<p>When the block is due to an officer's own reticence, mistaken
ideas about the requirements of his position, or feeling of
strangeness toward his fellows, the only cure for him is to dive
head-first into the cold, clear water, like a boy at the old
swimming hole in the early spring. Thereby he will grow in
self-confidence even as he progresses in knowledge of the character
of his men and of human nature in general.</p>

<p>If an officer is senior, and is still somewhat on the bashful
side, by watching the manner of his own seniors when he gets
counsel, and thawing toward his immediate juniors, thereby increasing
his receptiveness toward them, there will occur a chain
reaction to the bottom level.</p>

<p>The block, however, is not always of the mind and heart. No
man can help his own face, but it can sometimes be a barrier to
communication. One commander in European Theater was told
by his Executive that his subordinates were fearful to approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
him because of his perpetual scowl. He assembled his officers
and he said to them: "I have been told that my looks are forbidding.
The mirror reminds me of that every morning. Years
ago I was in a grenade explosion, and a consequent eye injury
and strain have done to me what you have to see every time we
get together. But if you cannot look beyond the face, and judge
my disposition by all else that you see of me in our work together,
you do not yet have the full perception that is commensurate
with your responsibility."</p>

<p>The too-formal manner, the overrigid attitude, the disposition
to deal with any human problem by-the-numbers as if it
were only one more act in organizational routine, can have
precisely the same chilling effect upon men as came of this
officer's scowl. Though no man may move wholly out of his
own nature, a cheerfulness of manner in the doing of work is
altogether within any individual's capabilities, and is the highest-test
lubricant of his human relationships.</p>

<p>As a further safeguard against making himself inaccessible,
the officer needs to make an occasional check on the procedures
which have been established by his immediate subordinates. At
all levels of command it is the pet task of those "nearest the
throne" to think up new ways to keep all hands from "bothering
the old man." However positive an order to the contrary,
they will not infrequently contrive to circumvent it, mistakenly
believing that by this act they save him from himself. Many
a compassionate commander leads an unwontedly lonely life because
of the peculiar solicitude of his staff in this matter and
his own failure to discover what is happening to him. In this
way the best of intentions may be thwarted. There is no sure
cure for the evil but personal reconnaissance.</p>

<p>It is never a waste of time for the commander, or for any
officer, to talk to his people about their personal problems.
More times than not, the problem will seem small to him, but
so long as it looms large to the man, it cannot be dismissed
with a wave of the hand. Ridicule, sarcasm and the brush-off
are equally inexcusable in any situation where one individual
takes another into his confidence on any matter which does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
not involve bad faith on the part of the petitioner. Even then,
if the man imparts that which shows that his own conduct has
been reprehensible or that he would enlist the support of his
superior in some unworthy act, it is better to hear him through
and then skin him, than to treat what he says in the offhand
manner. An officer will grow in the esteem of his men only as
he treats their affairs with respect. The policy of patience and
goodwill pays off tenfold because what happens to one man is
soon known to the others.</p>

<p>In this particular there has been a radical change within the
services during the current century, simply because of broader
understanding of human relationships. In the Old Army, the
man could get through to his commander only if he could
satisfy the First Sergeant as to the nature of his business; this
was a roadblock for the man who either was afraid of the
First Sergeant, or was loath to let the latter know about his
affairs. Custom dies hard and this one has not been entirely
uprooted. But the distance we have traveled toward humanizing
all command principles is best reflected by the words of
General Eisenhower in "Command in Europe": "Hundreds of
broken-hearted fathers, mothers, and sweethearts wrote me personal
letters begging for some hope that a loved one might still
be alive, or for additional detail as to the manner of his death.
Every one of these I answered."</p>

<p>It is not necessary that an officer wet-nurse his men in order
to serve well in the role of counsel. His door should be open,
but he does not play the part either of a father confessor or of
a hotel greeter. Neither great solemnity nor effusiveness are
called for, but mainly serious attention to the problem, and then
straight-forward advice or decision, according to the nature
of the case, <em>and provided that from his own knowledge and
experience he feels qualified to give it</em>. If not, it is wiser to
defer than to offer a half-baked opinion. To consider for a
time, and to seek light from others, whether higher authority
or one's closer associates, is the sound alternative when there is
a great deal at stake for the man and the problem is too complex
for its solution to be readily apparent. The spirit in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
this work should be undertaken is nowhere more clearly indicated
than in the words of Schuyler D. Hoslett who in his
book, "Human Factor in Management," said this: "Counseling
is advising an individual on his problem to the extent that an
attempt is made to help him understand it so he may carry
out a plan for its solution. It is a process which stimulates the
individual's ability for self-direction."</p>

<p>Family affairs, frictions within the organization, personal entanglements
which prey upon the mind, frustrations and anxieties
of varying kind, the sense of failure and other nameless
fears which are rooted deep in the consciousness of nearly every
individual, are the more general subjects in counseling.</p>

<p>Whatever impairs the man that he wishes to take up with his
officer becomes ipso facto the officer's rightful business. Equally
so, on the positive side, when his only desire is to bring forward
something that he believes would serve the interests of organization,
he should be heard.</p>

<p>In either case, the perfecting of counsel develops around two
controlling ideas, stated in the order of their importance: (1)
what is in the best interests of the unit, and (2) what is for the
good of the man. In this particular, the officer as counselor is
rarely in the role of a disinterested party. Unlike the preacher,
the lawyer, the teacher or the best friend, he has to look beyond
what is beneficial simply to the spiritual, mental and moral need
of one individual. There is an abiding necessity to equate the
personal problem to the whole philosophy within which a
command operates. <em>To keep in mind that every individual has
his breaking point is everlastingly important. But to remember
that the unit is also made of brittle stuff is not less so.</em></p>

<p>When undue personal favors are granted, when precedents
are set without weighing the possible effects upon all concerned,
when men are incontinently urged, or even sympathetically
humored by their superiors toward the taking of a weak personal
course, the ties of the organization are injured, tension
within it mounts and the ranks lose respect for the manhood
of their leaders.</p>

<p>All things are to be viewed in moderation, and with com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>passion,
but with a fine balance toward the central purpose. Let
us take one example. Within a given command, at a particular
time, leaves have been made so restricted, for command reasons,
that there must be a showing of genuine urgency. One
man comes forward and says that he is so sick for the sight of
home that he can no longer take duty. As certainly as his
superior tries to facilitate this man's purpose because of fear
that he will break, the superior will be harassed by other requests
with no better basis, and if they are not granted, there
will be general discontent. On the other hand, suppose another
man comes forward. A wire from home has informed him that
his mother is dying. If the superior will not go to bat on such
a case, he will win the deserved contempt of the same men
who were ready to take advantage of the other opening, but in
this instance would seek nothing for themselves.</p>

<p>To know the record, the character and the measure of goodwill
of the subject is all-important in counseling. It puts the
matter in much too dim a light to say that after the call comes,
the officer should check up on these points so that he can deal
knowledgeably with the man. That is his first order of business
within the unit&mdash;to learn all that he can about the main
characteristics of his men. This general duty precedes the detail
work of counseling. Under normal circumstances, no officer is
likely to have more than 250 men in his immediate charge.
There are exceptions, but this is broadly the rule. It is by no
means an excessive task for one individual to learn the names
and a great part of the history of the men he sees daily, when
not knowing them means that he has neglected the heart of
operations.</p>

<p>What the man says of himself, in relation to the problem,
deserves always to be judged according to his own record. If he
has proved himself utterly faithful, action can be taken on the
basis of his word. If he is known to be a corner-cutter and a
cheat, his case, though listened-to with interest and sympathy,
needs to be taken with a grain of salt, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>World War II officers had to abide by this standard in deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>ing
with the general malaise which arose out of redeployment.
When a man came forward and said that he couldn't take it
any more, and the commander knew that he had always been
a highly dutiful individual, it became the commander's job to
attempt to get the man home. But when a second man came
forward with the same story, and the record showed that he had
always shirked his work, the question was whether he should be
given the final chance to shirk it again. To favor the first man
meant furthering discipline; his comrades recognized it as a
fair deal. To turn back the second man was equally constructive
to the same end. In a general situation of unique
pressure, commanders found that these principles worked.</p>

<p>Many of the problems on which men seek advice of their
officers are of a legal nature; unless an officer is versed in the
law, the inquiry must be channeled to a qualified source. Other
problems are of a kind that use should be made of the home
services of such an organization as the Red Cross. A knowledge
of the limits beyond which the help of a special office or
agency must be sought is therefore as important to the officer-consultant
as an ability to give the man full information about
the whereabouts and use of these facilities.</p>

<p>The Red Cross is usually an effective agent in checking the
facts of a home situation and returning the data. But at the end
of the line where officer and man sit together, its resources for
helping the individual (when what is needed mainly is advice
on a human equation) are not likely to be any better than what
his military superiors can do for him. In any time of crisis, the
normal human being can draw strength and composure far
more surely from a person he well knows than from a stranger.</p>

<p>There is this illustration. During World War II, many a man
overseas got word that his home had been broken up. The
counselor could talk the thing out with him, learn whether a
reconciliation was the one most important thing, or whether the
man was groping his way, looking for a friend who could help
him see the matter in proportion, and weigh, among other
things, his duty to himself. The Red Cross could check the
facts of the home situation. But the man's readjustment de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>pended
in the main on what was done by those who were
closest to him.</p>

<p>Sooner or later every commander has to deal with some refraction
of this kind of problem. When it comes, moralizing and
generalizing about the weakness of human nature does no good
whatever. To call the man a fool is as invidious as to waste
indignation upon the cause of his misfortune. Likewise, any
frontal approach to the problem, such as telling the man,
"Here's what you should do," should be shunned, or used most
sparingly. The more effective attitude can be expressed in these
words: "If it had happened to me instead of to you, and I
were in your same situation, here are the things I would consider,
and here are the points to which I would give greatest
weight." To tell any subject to brace up and be a man is a
plain inference that he is not one. To reflect with him on the
things which manhood requires is the gentle way toward stirring
his self-respect. So doing, a counselor renews his own character.
<em>Also worth remembering is that in any man's dark hour, a pat
on the back and an earnest handclasp may work a small miracle.</em></p>

<p>There is much counseling over the subject of transfer. Herein
lies an exception to a general rule, for in this case the good of
the man takes precedence over the good of organization. No
conscientious officer likes to see a good man depart from his
organization. Nevertheless, the service is not in competition with
itself, and it advances as a whole in the measure that all men
find the niche where they can serve most efficiently, and with
the greatest satisfaction. There are officers who hold to every
able subordinate like grim death, seeing no better way to advance
their personal fortunes. This is a sign of moral weakness,
not of strength, and its inevitable fruit is discontent within the
organization. <em>The sign of superiority in any officer, at whatever
level, is his confidence that he can make another good man to
fill any vacancy.</em> When it is self-evident that a man can better
himself and profit the service through transfer, it is contrary to
all principle to deny him that right. This does not mean that
the unit's exit door should be kept open, but only that it should
be ready to yield upon a showing of competent proof. It is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
unusual that when the pressure mounts and war danger rises,
many a man develops a sudden conviction that he would be
more useful in a noncombat arm. The officer body itself is not
unsusceptible to the same temptation. Unless the great majority
are held to that line of duty which they had accepted in less
dangerous circumstance, the service would soon cease to have
fighting integrity. But it makes no point to keep men in a combat
arm or service who are quite obviously morally and physically
unequipped for its rigor, and it is equally wasteful to
deny some other arm or service the use of a specialist whose
skills fill it particularly. Some of the ablest commanders in our
service have abided by this rule: They never denied the man
who had a legitimate reason for transfer, and they never shuffled
off their lemons and goldbricks under a false label. Though
seemingly idealistic, the rule is also practical. The time wasted
in excessive worry over a discard is sometimes better spent by
concentrating on the value of trumps.</p>

<p>Men tend to seek officer counsel when they feel discriminated
against by lesser authority. When that happens, it is the duty of
the officer to get at the facts, and act according to them. Complaints
against any junior are always unpleasant to hear because
of their air of intrigue. Tactlessly handled, without due weighing
of the case from both sides, they turn one blunder into two.
But no officer is well-advised if he believes that his duty automatically
is to uphold the arm of a subordinate when the facts
say that the latter is dead wrong. His duty is to reduce friction
wherever it is caused by a misuse of power. This implies dealing
discreetly with the offender instead of directly discountenancing
him.</p>

<p>There are a few broad, common-sense rules which, when followed,
will enable any officer to play his part more effectively
in the counseling of men.</p>


<ul>
<li>Privacy is requisite and the interview should not be held
at an hour when interruptions are likely.</li>

<li>A listless manner spoils everything, diminishes the force of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
reason and discourages confidence.</li>

<li>To put the man at ease immediately by some personal
gesture is more important than observing forms.</li>

<li>Thereafter the situation is best served by relaxation of
bearing rather than by tension.</li>

<li>All excess of expression is a failing, but above all in the
man to whom another looks for guidance.</li>

<li>To listen well is the prelude toward pondering carefully
and speaking wisely.</li>

<li>No counsel is worthy that has any lower aim than one's own
ideals of self-respect.</li>

<li>Early enough is well; quickly done can be quickly undone.</li>

<li>To refuse with kindness is more winning than to acquiesce
ungraciously.</li>

<li>To note another man's mood, and to become congenial to
it, is the surest way to engage his confidence.</li>

<li>Decisions which are wholly of the heart and not of the
mind will ultimately do hurt to both places.</li>

<li>No man will talk freely if met by silence, but an intelligent
question encourages frankness above all else.</li>

<li>When one man loses possession of himself it is the more
reason that the other should tighten his reserve.</li>

<li>Affectation in one's own manner gives the lie to one's own
credit and destroys it with others.</li>

<li>To express pity for a man does not serve to restore him
and put him above pity.</li>

<li>When a man is so burdened by a personal problem that it
shuts out all else, he must be led to something else.</li>

<li>Imprudent tactics can undo the wisest strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these dispositions have particular value in relation to
the counseling of one's subordinates, they also have some application
to any situation in which men work and commune together.
Men at any level do not mistake the touch of sincerity,
nor fail to mark as unworthy of trust the man who pays only a
superficial regard to a matter which they deem important.</p>

<p>For the officer already burdened with other duties, counseling
may seem like a waste of time, and an activity that more properly
belongs to the chaplain. The wise and understanding "padre"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
may sometimes counsel men on their material problems and
thereby assist the officer who is over troops. But so doing, he is
committing a trespass unless he acts with the commander's
knowledge and consent. The commander is the foster father of
the men in his organization. When he renounces this role, he
neglects a trust.</p>

<p>That neglect cuts the fighting efficiency of the unit at its
root. Finally, counseling, like all else in military life, has a
combat purpose. Other things being equal, the tactical unity of
men working together in combat will be in ratio to their knowledge
and sympathetic understanding of each other. Whatever
the cause, aloofness on the part of the officer can only produce
a further withdrawal on the part of the man. Finally, the cost
comes high. In battle, and out of it, the failure to act and to
communicate is more often due to timidity in the individual
than to fear of physical danger.</p>

<p>Described in cold type, the counseling process probably appears
a little sticky. Actually, it is nothing of the sort. For it has
been going on ever since man became civilized. It is a force in
all organized human relationships, beginning in infanthood
and lasting through old age. Because of the nature of a military
group, and particularly because of the deriving of united
strength from well-being in each of the component parts, there
is much more need to regularize it and to qualify all men in a
knowledge of those things which will enable them to assist a
fellow in need of help. But in the military society, far more
than in civil life, confidence is a two-way street. It would be
almost impossible to express the collective gratitude of tens of
thousands of lieutenants and ensigns who in times past have
learned to rely on the friendly counsel of a veteran sergeant or
petty officer, and have usually gotten it straight from the shoulder,
<em>but with respect</em>. The breaking-in of most young officers,
and the acclimating of them to their role in a command system,
is due, in large measure, to support from this source. Nor are
senior commanders reluctant to receive moral comfort of this
same kind in periods of crisis.</p>

<p>When the planes of the First Tokyo Raid under Col. James<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
H. Doolittle, crashed among the mountains and along the sea-coast
of Eastern China, after one of the most valiant strokes in
our military annals, their commander was among the few who
had the added misfortune of coming to earth within the Japanese
lines. By fate's mercy, he just happened to escape by walking
between the enemy outposts. Farther along, he saw the
wreck of another of his planes. Then he came to a third; it was
smashed beyond hope. But its crew had already heard from
several other parties. They too had lost their B-25's to the fog,
the night and the crags. Doolittle realized then that everything
was gone, lives saved yes, but otherwise the expedition was a
total ruin.</p>

<p>The Commander sat for a long time in the cockpit of the
wrecked plane, terribly depressed, thinking only of how totally
he had failed.</p>

<p>At last one of the younger men, Sgt. Paul Leonard walked
up to him and said: "What's the matter, Colonel?"</p>

<p>Doolittle said: "It couldn't be worse. We've lost everything.
We've let the country down."</p>

<p>The kid said: "Why, Colonel, you've got this all wrong. You
have no idea how this looks to the United States. Don't you
realize that right now they're getting ready to make you a
general? Why I'll make you a bet they give you the Congressional
Medal."</p>

<p>Doolittle thanked him. He thought it was a nice thing for
the boy to say. That kind of loyalty was worth having in a bad
hour. The boy started to walk away; he could tell that Doolittle
didn't believe a word of it. Then suddenly he turned and came
on back.</p>

<p>"Colonel," he said, "I'd like to make a deal with you. Suppose
I'm right about it and you're wrong. So they give you a star
and the Congressional Medal. If that happens, will you agree
to take me with you wherever you go?"</p>

<p>Doolittle made him a solemn promise. Fresh courage came to
him out of the boy's tremendous earnestness.</p>

<p>And of course the boy was right, and the contract was kept,
and all things went well until, by a savage irony, Sgt. Leonard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
was killed in the last German raid against Doolittle's headquarters
in Europe shortly before the war ended.</p>

USING REWARD AND PUNISHMENT</h3>


<p>One of the illusions having greatest currency among our
people is that any green member of the fighting establishment
is merely an American civilian in a uniform, and that therefore,
his spirit is nourished to the extent that accommodations and
usages of the service most nearly duplicate what he has known
elsewhere.</p>

<p>This belief is especially prevalent during wartime when every
mother's son puts on a new suit; it is natural to think that
everything in the service will better suit the boy if it smells
like home. The corollary of this rather quaint idea is that military
organization is therefore most perfect when it operates in
the same way as the civil society.</p>

<p>Earlier in this book it has been suggested that these ideas
need to be questioned on two broad grounds: Do not both of
them run counter to the facts of encharged responsibility, and
to human nature itself?</p>

<p>To emphasize it once again, the military officer is not alone
an administrator: <em>he is a magistrate</em>. There are special powers
given him by the President. It is within these powers that he
will sit in judgment on his men and that he may punish them
when they have been grievously derelict. This dual role makes
his function radically different from anything encountered in
civil life&mdash;to say nothing of the singleness of purpose which a
fighting service is supposed to move forward.</p>

<p>Moreover, the military officer is dealing with men who are
submitted to him in a binding relationship which by its nature
is not only more compelling but more intimate than anything
elsewhere in society. As much as the parent in the home, and
far more than the teacher in the school or the executive in business,
he is directed to center his effort primarily on the building
of good character in other individuals.</p>

<p>One need only compare a few points of advantage and dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>advantage
to see why a better balanced sense of justice and fair
play is required of the military officer than of his brother in
civil life, and why the aim would be far too low if the fighting
services did not shoot for higher standards of personnel direction
than are common in the management of American business.
Here are the points:</p>


<ul>
<li>If any subordinate in the civilian vineyard feels that he is getting a bad
deal from his boss, and has become the object of unfair discrimination,
it is his royal American privilege to quit on the spot, be he a policeman,
a government factotum or a hod carrier. He can then maintain himself
by carrying his skill into a new shop. But an enlisted member of the
armed establishment cannot quit summarily, and finally, if his commander
is just wrong-headed and arbitrary, it can be made almost impossible for
him to transfer out. However bad his fortune, he's stuck with it.</li>

<li>Nepotism is so general in our business and political life that the people
who suffer from its effect accept it more or less as the working of nature;
the results are therefore less destructive of efficiency than they might
be otherwise. It is common to see the boss's nephew or his son get a good
spot in the office and then rise like a rocket, even though he is a third-rater.
And it is not less common to see a straw boss in a factory favor
the man whom he thinks might grease the wheels for him on the outside.
But in the armed establishment, favoritism on any grounds, and
particularly on such treacherous grounds as these, will destroy the foundations
of work and of control.</li>

<li>The armed establishment has its own body of law. Therein, too, it
differs from any civilian autonomy except the state itself. The code is
intended to enable a uniform standard of treatment to all individuals
in the regulating of all interior affairs. The code is not rigid; its provisions
are not absolute. It specifies the general nature of offenses against
society, and special offenses against the good of the service. But, except
for the more serious offenses, particularly those which by their nature
also violate the civil code, it does not flatly prescribe trial and punishment.
Military law, in this respect, has more latitude, and is more congenial,
than civil law covering minor offenders. Rarely arbitrary in its
workings, it premises the use of corrective good judgment at all times.
It regards force as an instrument only to be used for conserving the general
good of the establishment. The essential power behind the force is something
spiritual&mdash;the will and conscience of the great majority, expressing
itself through the action of one or several of their number. Its major
object is not punishment of the wrong-doer but protection of the interests
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of the dutiful. This view of military law is four-square with the basic
principle of all action within the armed services&mdash;<em>that in all cases the</em>
<em>best policy is one which depends for its workings on the sense of duty in</em>
<em>men toward each other, and thereby strengthens that sense through its</em>
<em>operations.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Put in these terms, the attitude of the service toward the
problem of correction as a means of promoting the welfare of
the general establishment obviously reposes a tremendous burst
in the justice and goodwill of the average officer. It would be
useless to blink the fact. But there is this to be said unalterably
in favor of the military system's way of handling things: If the
organization of the whole human family into an orderly unit is
ever to be made possible, it will be done only because many men,
of all ages and working at many different levels, develop this
faculty for passing critical, impartial judgment on the conduct
and deserts of those whom they lead, instead of regarding it
as a special kind of wisdom, given only to the few anointed.
Nor is that all. Not only the knowledge but the sense of duty in
men is imperfect. In every society are men who will not obey
the law of their own accord. Unless the authority which receives
and interprets the law will also impose it, by force if
necessary, the reign of law soon ceases. Whether an ordered
society is to exist thus depends upon whether there are citizens
enough, fixed with a sense of duty, to obey it and to enforce it.</p>

<p>At first glance, the responsibility seems extraordinarily heavy
and difficult. But with broadening experience, it becomes almost
second nature to an officer quickly to set a course by
which to judge individual men in relation to the affairs of organization,
provided that he has steered all along in the light
of a few elementary principles.</p>

<p>Concerning reward, and equally with respect to punishments,
no more pertinent words could be said than those uttered long
ago by Thomas Carlyle: "What a reflection it is that we cannot
bestow on an unworthy man any particle of our benevolence,
our patronage or whatever resource is ours&mdash;without withdrawing
it, and all that will grow out of it, from one worthy, to
whom it of right belongs! We cannot, I say; impossible; it is
the eternal law of things."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>He said a number of important things in this one brief paragraph.
There is first the thought that when any reward, such
as a promotion, a commendation or a particularly choice assignment
is given other than to the man who deserves it on sheer
merit, some other man is robbed and the ties of organization
are weakened.</p>

<p>Next, there is this proposition: if, in the dispensing of punishment,
undue leniency is extended to an individual who has
already proved that he merits no special consideration, in the
next round a bum rap will be given some lesser offender who is
morally deserving of a real chance. The Italians have an epigram:
"The first time a dog bites a man, it's the dog's fault;
the second time, it's the man's fault."</p>

<p>According to Carlyle, these things have the strength of a
natural law. Nor is it necessary to take his word for it. Any
wise and experienced military administrator will say approximately
the same thing and will tell of some of the bad examples
he has met along his way.... The commander who was afraid
to punish anybody and by his indecision punished everybody....
The lieutenant who had such a bad conscience about his
own weak handling of a bad case of indiscipline that he threw
the book at the next offender and thereby spoiled a good man
and gained the ill will of the company.... The old timer who
smarted under excessive punishment for a trivial offense, broke
under it, got into worse trouble, and became a felon.... The
officer who promoted his pets instead of his good men and at
last found that there were no good men left.... The skipper who
condoned a small case of insolence until it swelled into a
mutiny.... The fool who handled every case alike, as if he were
an animal trainer instead of a builder of human character ...
and so on, ad infinitum. It is a long and sorry list, but the
overwhelming majority of dutiful executives in the armed services
avoid these stupid blunders by following a Golden Rule
policy toward their men.</p>

<p>If lack of obedience is the most frequent cause of service men
being brought on the carpet, then as obedience is a moral
quality, so should punishment be employed as a moral act, its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
prime purpose being to nourish and foster obedience. Before
meting punishment, it is necessary to judge a man, and judgment
means to think over, to compare, to weigh probable effects
on the man and on the command, and to give the offender
the benefit of any reasonable doubt. Before any punishment is
given, the questions must be faced: "What good will it achieve?"
If the answer is none, then punishment is not in order. Punishment
of a vindictive nature is a crime; when it is given uselessly,
or handed out in a strictly routine manner, it is an immoral act.</p>

<p>But when punishment has to be awarded, the case must be
handled promptly, and its issue must be stated incisively, so that
there is no room for doubt that the officer is certain about his
judgments. Men know when they are in the wrong, and even
when it works to their disadvantage, they will feel increased
respect toward the officer who knows what should be done, and
states it without hemming and hawing. The showing of firmness
is the first requirement in this kind of action. It is as foolish
to go back on a punishment as to threaten it and not follow
through. The officer who is always running around threatening
to court martial his subordinates is merely avowing his own
weakness, and crying that he has lost all of his moral means.
Even the dullest men do not mistake vehemence and abuse
for signs of strength.</p>

<p>To punish a body of men, for offenses committed by two or
three of their number, even though the offense is obnoxious and
it is impossible to put the finger on the culprits, is the act of
a sadist, and is no more excusable within military organization
than in civilian society. Any officer who resorts to this stupid
practice will forfeit the loyalty of the best men in his command.
There is no reason why it should be otherwise.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it is a serious error to reprimand a subordinate
in the presence of any other person, because of the unnecessary
hurt to his pride. But circumstances moderate the
rule. If the offense for which he is being reprimanded involves
injury of any sort to some other person, or persons, it may be
wholly proper to apply the treatment in their presence. For example,
the bully or the smart-aleck who wantonly humiliates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
his own subordinates is not entitled to have his own feelings
spared. However, in the presence of his own superior, an officer
is always ill-advised to administer oral punishment to one of
his own juniors, since the effect is to destroy confidence both up
and down the line.</p>

<p>It is always the duty of an officer to intervene, toward the
protection of his own men against any manifest injustice, whatever
its source. In fact, this trust is so implicit that he should be
ready to risk his professional reputation upon it, when he is
convinced beyond doubt that the man is being unfairly assailed,
or that due process is not being followed. Both higher authority
and civil authority occasionally overreach; an officer stands as
a shield protecting his men against unfair treatment from any
quarter. <em>But it is decidedly not his duty to attempt to cheat
law or thwart justice for the sake of his men simply because
they are his men.</em> His job, as Shakespeare puts it, is "to unmask
falsehood and bring truth to light, to wrong the wronger till
he render right."</p>

<p>Finally, the best policy on punishments is to eliminate the
frictions which are the cause of most transgressions. When a
ship is happy, men do their duty. Scarcely anything will cross
them up more quickly than to see rewards given with an uneven
hand. Even the stinker who has no ambition but to duck work
can recognize a deserving man, and will burn if that man is
bypassed in favor of a bootlicker or some other lightweight.</p>

<p>Nothing is more vain than to give a promotion, or any reward,
in the hope, or on the promise, that the character who
receives it will hit the sawdust trail and suddenly reform.</p>

<p>Duty is the only sure proving ground. Men, like motors,
should be judged on their all-around performance. There is no
other way to generate the steady pull over the long grind.</p>

FITTING MEN TO JOBS</h3>


<p>In civilian society, what amounts to a cult has developed
around the idea that the average person has a natural bent for
some particular job or profession, which if thwarted will
fill him with those frustrations which are conceded to be the
cause of most of the mental and moral disorders of mankind.</p>

<p>Therefore if all men could become rightly placed, we would
have Utopia tomorrow.</p>

<p>This theory of what humanity mainly cries for is perforce
rejected by the military establishment, for several eminently
practical as well as ideal reasons.</p>

<p>It discounts man, his plastic and impressionable nature, his
response to all that goes on around him and his marked ability
to adjust to any environment. He is not like a bolt fitted into a
hole by a riveter, nor merely clay in the hands of the potter.
What he becomes is mainly of his own making.</p>

<p>Further, the theory does not meet the needs of the situation,
since in the services, as elsewhere, there are not enough better
holes to go around, and no man is ready to say that he is good
for nothing but life as a file-closer.</p>

<p>But the last and main reason why the theory is no good is
that it doesn't square with human experience. A narrow classification
system invites the danger of overspecialization and lessens
the team play which is so indispensable to all military
enterprise. It is possible for the machine to break down totally
from lack of interchangeability in its parts.</p>

<p>We learn much from war, but some of the most obvious lessons
are disregarded. One of the things that it should teach us
is the tremendous adaptability of the average intelligent man, his
ability to take hold of work altogether remote from any prior
experience, master it, and find satisfaction in it, provided he is
given help and encouragement by those who already know.</p>

<p>This is the great phenomenon of war&mdash;greater than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
atomic bomb or supersonic flight. Former bookkeepers emerge
as demolitions men. Divinity students become pharmacist's
mates. School teachers operate tanks. Writing men turn into
navigators. Woodsmen become lecturers. Longshoremen specialize
in tactics. And all goes well.</p>

<p>Then when it is all over, and everyone gets back in his
well-worn groove, the social scientists explain that these miracles
occurred because under the stimulus of great fear and excitement
which attends a period of national emergency, individuals
will sublimate their main drives, and adjust temporarily to what
would be otherwise an onerous personal difficulty. Sheer poppycock!
Normal men do not feel pressed by fear simply because a
state of war exists; their chief emotions change scarcely at all.
These transformations occur only because the man had the
potential all along, and with someone backing him up <em>and giving
him the feeling of success</em>, his incentives became equal, at
least, to anything he had known in his peacetime occupation.</p>

<p>That is the long-and-short of it. If our average man couldn't
become a jack of many trades, and a master of several, the
United States would never be able to meet a major war emergency.</p>

<p>For these reasons, service concepts of how men should be
fitted to jobs do not develop around the simple notion that it
is all a matter of putting a square peg in a square hole&mdash;which
is the one best way to deny the peg any room for expansion.
The doctrine is that <em>men are many sided, that they learn their
own powers and likes through experiment, that they are entitled
to find what is best for them, and that having found it, their
satisfactions will still derive mainly from intelligent and interested
treatment by their superiors</em>.</p>

<p>Every officer arrives sooner or later at the point where he
has a direct hand in the placement of men. By way of preparation
for that responsibility he should do two things mainly&mdash;learn
all that he can from his superiors about its technical
aspects, and in his own thinking, concentrate on principles to
the exclusion of detail.</p>

<p>The fundamental purpose of all training today is to develop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the natural faculties and stimulate the brain of the individual
rather than to treat him as a cog which has to be fitted into a
great machine.</p>

<p>The true purpose of <em>all</em> rules covering the conduct of warfare
and all regulations pertaining to the conduct of its individuals
is to bring about order in the fighting machine rather than to
strangle the mind of the man who reads them.</p>

<p>Thus in the assignment of men to work within any military
organization, no amount of perfection in the analysis of skills
and aptitudes can compensate for carelessness in their subsequent
administration. The uniformed ranks are not mechanics,
storekeepers and clerks primarily, but fighting men. This makes
a difference. The optimum over-all results do not come from
the care exercised in seeing that every man is placed at exactly
the right job but from the concern taken that in whatever job
he fills, he will feel that he is supported and that his efforts are
appreciated. There is scarcely a good man who has served long
within the profession without filling a half-dozen roles requiring
vastly different skills. And looking back, what would the
average one say about it? Not that he was happiest where the
nature of the task best suited his hand, but happiest where his
relations with his superiors gave him the greatest sense of accomplishment.</p>

<p>That is the human nature of the equation. We can let the
economist argue that what a man puts into a job is largely
dependent on what he takes out of it. And we can let the
philosopher answer him that the fault in his proposition is that
he has turned it the wrong way 'round. Regardless of which
man has put the cart before the horse, there are two basic
truths which outweigh the merits of the argument.</p>

<p>First. <em>All human progress has come of the willingness of a
man at a particular time to undertake a job which no one had
ever done before.</em></p>

<p>Second. <em>The main reward of any job is the knowledge that
worthwhile work has been accomplished.</em></p>

<p>This last may sound like a corny maxim, but it's true. The
reason maxims become corny is because they're true.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Despite all of the present-day emphasis on paycheck security
as the mainspring of human action, the far stronger force which
moves man as a social being is his desire for a secure place in the
respect and affections of his associates, including his chief or
his employer. Gary Cooper, playing in "The Cowboy and the
Lady," used the line, "I aims, ma'm, to be high-regarded."
Except for the few wrong-headed people, he was speaking for
the whole human family.</p>

<p>The man who can get along without wanting or needing
words of approval from other people is fit for a cell by himself,
either padded or barred.</p>

<p>Loyalty in the masses of men waxes strong in the degree
that they are made to believe that real importance is attached
to their work and to their ability to think about their work. It
weakens at every point where they consider that there is a negative
respect for their intelligence; the dignity in any work is not
inherent in the job itself but in the attitude of others toward
it. Cabinet ministers, college presidents and industrial magnates
will quit their jobs when they feel they no longer have the
confidence of those to whom they are responsible. That experience
is as demoralizing to great men as to the mine-run.
Equally, the feeling of compensation which comes with any
token of recognition is one of those touches of human nature
which make all men akin. If men of genius and good works did
not find Nobel prizes and honorary college degrees highly gratifying,
this custom would have faded long ago. It is as rewarding
to them to be called good at their job as it was to the
New Jersey street sweeper who pushed his broom so diligently
that he swept halfway into the next town before discovering
his mistake.</p>

<p>The far inferences of these things should be reasonably clear
to every officer of the fighting establishment. It makes little
difference whether a man is digging a ditch or is working up a
loading table for an invasion: what he thinks about his work
will depend in large measure upon the attitude of his superiors.
He will develop no great conviction about what he is doing
except as it is transmitted to him. <em>The fundamental cause of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
breakdown of morale and discipline within the armed service
usually comes of this, that a commander or his subordinates
transgress by treating men as if they were children or serfs
instead of showing respect for their adulthood.</em></p>

<p>The requirements of modern war are such that we certainly
do not want to turn out one man exactly like another, or turn
the majority into mechanical men, capable of one set function.
But the rule applies to officers as well as men. The greater
freedom which is needed has nothing to do with social behavior
or privilege. It is the freedom to think boldly and originally for
the common good, for, to quote Kant again: "What one learns
the most fixedly and remembers the best is what one learns
more or less by oneself."</p>

<p>Thus in the matter of sizing up men, judging of their capacities
and trying to get them rightly placed, the need is not a
formula, since no formula will work. It is only by keeping
principles uppermost in our thoughts that the greatest measure
of common sense will prevail in our actions. That is what is
needed, rather than clairvoyant powers, or a master's degree in
psychology, if the service officer is to handle personnel efficiently.
There are no great wizards in this field: there are only men
who know more about the human nature of the problem than
others because they have had a zest for meeting humanity and
have built a text out of what others have told them.</p>

<p>The job begins by the search for data on the individual&mdash;all
of the data that may be obtained. It goes on from that to
sitting down with the subject, getting him to open up and talk
freely about himself, what he has done, what he would like to
do with his life, and his reasons for so feeling, et cetera. But the
information from all sources has to be balanced against one's
impression of the outer man, not just what he says but how he
talks, the degree of his attentiveness, his bearing, his eye, his
self-control. The decision is made on the basis of all these
reckonings. This is common sense in action, and the only alternatives
to it are to act upon a hunch or purely emotional
grounds; one might, with better reason, determine another man's
fortune by the flip of a coin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>Let's see briefly how the method works out in practice.</p>

<p>If the record shows that a man is a bad speller, careless
about punctuation, not interested in writing, non-experienced
at clerkship, and something of a rough diamond in his nature,
he would be a bad bet for the administrative side, or in supply
work, or in a communications role, though with a little polishing,
and provided that he seems self-assured and is what we
would call a "likeable" man, he might become a capital leader
of a tactical group.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the man who says he had tried in vain
to develop a manual skill, but has always been clumsy with his
hands, and is supported in what he says by the records of his
service, isn't necessarily excluded from becoming a good weapons
or demolitions man, if he seems strong in body and nerve,
though he would hardly do for a mechanic's berth, or a carpenter's
assistant or as a radio repairman. Weapons and demolitions
require strength, carefulness and good sense rather than
great dexterity.</p>

<p>Take the man who is uncommunicative, or morose or unusually
shy. From the day that he starts his service, his superiors
should do their best to help him to change his ways; these ingrown
men are roadblocks to group cooperation. But if he does
not pick up and become outgiving, he hasn't the quality of a
junior leader and there is no point in wasting space by sending
him to any school or course out of which it would be expected
that duties as an instructor would devolve upon him.</p>

<p>However, there is one word of extreme caution on this point.
For as long as 6 months after entering service, some men are
under abnormal constraint because they are in a new element,
and feel a little frightened inside. Whether this is the case is to
be judged best by getting full information on the man. If the
record shows that he had led his class in college, managed an
athletic team, headed a debating team in high school, been the
main wheel in a boy's club or a Scout troop, or led any kind of
group, this is to be taken as a sign that the potential is there
and that he is a sleeper. The most common error made in the
services is that we are prone to underscore that a man was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
lieutenant in a cadet company while taking no note of the file
who had greater prestige in other activities because of his
natural qualities as a leader.</p>

<p>These are only a few average samples of personnel handling,
and of elementary reasoning. As Mother Goose might say, if the
list had been longer, the case still wouldn't have been stronger.
Far more profitably, we can dig a little deeper into the subject
of principles.</p>

<p>In two senses, every decision as to the placing of men in the
armed service is a moral decision, and therein it differs from
average civilian responsibility. What is best for the man has
always to be measured against the ultimate security and fighting
objects of the establishment.</p>

<p>For example, it is dead wrong, even in time of peace, to
commit tactical leadership to the hands of the man whose
moral force clearly falls short of what is required on the field
of war, no matter how congenial he may be. And it is just as
wrong to let a blabbermouth work his way into security channels,
even though the hour is such that he can do no immediate
harm.</p>

<p>What importance should be attached to a man's estimate of
his own capabilities? It is always pertinent, but it is by no
means decisive. This is so for two reasons, the first being that the
majority of men tend to over-sell themselves on the thing they
like to do, and the second, that very few men know their own
dimensions. Almost consciously, men resist the thing that they
do not know, because of premonitory fears of failure. When the
Armored Force School was first organized in 1941, a private
from a unit stationed in Georgia was arbitrarily assigned to take
the radio course. He protested, saying that he did not like
anything about the field and therefore had no talent for it. But
his commander sent him along. Within 1 week after arriving
at Fort Knox, he was operating at a faster rate than any man
in the history of the Army. Every service could tell stories
of this kind; they are not miracles; they are regular features of
the daily show.</p>

<p>At the same time, the man who volunteers for a particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
line of duty&mdash;especially if it is a hard duty&mdash;already has
one mark in his favor. The fact that he wants to do it is one-half
of success. Before turning him down, there must be a substantially
clear showing that he lacks the main qualifications.
It must be a <em>compelling</em> reason, rather than the overweening
excuse that it is more convenient to keep him where he is. In
any case, he should be thanked for coming forward, and earmarked
as a good prospect for the next likely opening.</p>

<p>There is a slack saying in the services that "the good man
never volunteers." That is an outright canard. The best men
still do.</p>

<p>In job placement, mistakes are inevitable. Any authority in
this work will say so. Every experienced man who has had
conspicuous success in picking the right men, and in getting
scores of individuals started up the right ladder, will also shudder
a little as he recalls his particularly atrocious blunders.
Outward appearances are so greatly deceiving! The prior estimates
placed on men are so frequently highly colored or outright
dishonest!</p>

<p>As to the making of mistakes, it is just not enough to comment
that they have value, provided one has sufficient breadth
to learn from hard experience. What is vastly more important is
that the mistake, once made, will not be needlessly compounded.
That is a normal, human temptation. The attitude, "I don't
care if he is a chump; he's my chump," has nothing in its favor.
Yet it becomes a point of pride in some men that they will
not admit their judgments are fallible. Consequently, having
chosen the wrong man for a given responsibility, they will sustain
him there, come hell or high water, rather than make
public acknowledgement of error.</p>

<p>With what result? Mainly this, that for the sake of the point,
they win, with it, the contempt of their other subordinates.
For there is something very childish about this form of weakness,
though it is a failing not unknown in many men otherwise
qualified for high responsibility. To put it plainly, <em>no man</em>
has the moral right to suffer this upon any organization he is
professing to serve.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>The advice of one's subordinates, as to the placement and
promotion of men with whom they are in close contact, is
not to be followed undeviatingly. Men play favorites: they will
sometimes back an individual for no better reason than that
they "like the guy." Too, each small group leader, even the
best one, will work to advance the interests of his own men,
because so doing is part of his own buildup. Unless decisions
are made from a central point of view, the subordinate who
talks the most convincingly will get an extra portion of favor
for his men, and jealousies will wrack the organization.</p>

<p>There is one last point. No officer can progress in fitting men
to jobs except as he becomes better informed about job requirements.
This is an essential part of his education. There is
no administrative technique which is separate and apart from
knowledge of how basic work is performed in the fields which
have to be administered. A great many officers resist this truth,
but it is nonetheless valid.</p>

<p>What is eternally surprising in the fighting services is how
the aggressive questing for knowledge continues to pay large
dividends, and leads, in the average case, to a general forgiveness
of one's little sins and vices.</p>

AMERICANS IN COMBAT</h3>


<p>The command and control of men in combat <em>can</em> be mastered
by the junior leaders of American forces short of actual
experience under enemy fire.</p>

<p>It is altogether possible for a young officer his first time in
battle to be in total possession of his faculties and moving by
instinct to do the right thing, provided that he has made the
most of his training opportunities.</p>

<p>Exercise in the maneuvering of men is only an elementary
introduction to this educational process. The basic requirement
is a continuing study, first of the nature of men, second
of the techniques which produce unified action, and last, of the
history of past operations, which are covered by an abundant
literature.</p>

<p>Provided always that this collateral study is sedulously carried
forward by the individual officer, at least 90 percent of all
that is given him during the training period becomes applicable
to his personal action and his power to lead other men when
under fire.</p>

<p>Each service has its separate character. The fighting problem
of each differs in some measure from those of all others. In the
nature of things, the task of successfully leading men in battle
is partly conditioned by the unique character and mission of
each service.</p>

<p>It would therefore be gratuitous, and indeed impossible, to
attempt to outline a doctrine which would be of general application,
stipulating methods, techniques, etc., which would apply
to all Americans in combat, no matter in what element they
engaged.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few simple and fundamental propositions
to which the Armed Services subscribe in saying to the
officer corps what may be expected of the average man of the
United States under the conditions of battle. Generally speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>ing,
they have held true of Americans in times past from Lexington
to Okinawa. The fighting establishment builds its discipline,
training, code of conduct and public policy around
these ideas, believing that what served yesterday will also be
the one best way tomorrow, and for so long as our traditions
and our system of freedoms survive. These propositions are:</p>

<p class="proposition">I</p>

<p>When led with courage and intelligence, an American will
fight as willingly and as efficiently as any fighter in world
history.</p>

<p class="proposition">II</p>

<p>His keenness and endurance in war will be in proportion to
the zeal and inspiration of his leadership.</p>

<p class="proposition">III</p>

<p>He is resourceful and imaginative, and the best results will
always flow from encouraging him to use his brain along with
his spirit.</p>

<p class="proposition">IV</p>

<p>Under combat conditions he will reserve his greatest loyalty
for the officer who is most resourceful in the tactical employment
of his forces and most careful to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>

<p class="proposition">V</p>

<p>He is to a certain extent machine-bound because the nature
of our civilization has made him so. In an emergency, he tends
to look around for a motor car, a radio or some other gadget
that will facilitate his purpose, instead of thinking about using
his muscle power toward the given end. In combat, this is a
weakness which thwarts contact and limits communications.
Therefore it needs to be anticipated and guarded against.</p>

<p class="proposition">VI</p>

<p>War does not require that the American be brutalized or
bullied in any measure whatever. His need is an alert mind and
a toughened body. Hate and bloodlust are not the attributes of
a sound training under the American system. To develop clearly
a line of duty is sufficient to point Americans toward the
doing of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p class="proposition">VII</p>

<p>Except on a Hollywood lot, there is no such thing as an
American fighter "type." Our best men come in all colors,
shapes, and sizes. They appear from every section of the Nation,
including the territories.</p>

<p class="proposition">VIII</p>

<p>Presupposing soundness in their officer leadership, the majority
of Americans in any group or unit can be depended upon
to fight loyally and obediently, and will give a good account of
themselves.</p>

<p class="proposition">IX</p>

<p>In battle, Americans do not tend to fluctuate between emotional
extremes, in complete dejection one day and in exultation
the next, according to changes in the situation. They continue,
on the whole, on a fairly even keel, when the going is tough
and when things are breaking their way. Even when heavily
shocked by battle losses, they tend to bound back quickly.
Though their griping is incessant, their natural outlook is on
the optimistic side, and they react unfavorably to the officer
who looks eternally on the dark side.</p>

<p class="proposition">X</p>

<p>During battle, American officers are not expected either to
drive their men or to be forever in the van, as if praying to be
shot. So long as they are with their men, taking the same
chances as their men, and showing a firm grasp of the situation
and of the line of action which should be followed, the
men will go forward.</p>

<p class="proposition">XI</p>

<p>In any situation of extreme pressure, or moral exhaustion,
where men cannot otherwise be rallied and led forward, officers
are expected to do the actual physical act of leading, such as
performing as first scout, or point, even though this means
taking over what normally would be an enlisted man's function.</p>

<p class="proposition">XII</p>

<p>The normal, gregarious American is not at his best when
playing a lone-handed or tactically isolated part in battle. He is
not a kamikaze or a one-man torpedo. Consequently, the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
tactical results obtain from those dispositions and methods which
link the power of one man to that of another. Men who feel
strange with their unit, having been carelessly received by it,
and indifferently handled, will rarely, if ever, fight strongly and
courageously. But if treated with common decency and respect,
they will perform like men.</p>

<p class="proposition">XIII</p>

<p>Within our school of military thought, higher authority does
not consider itself infallible. Either in combat or out, in any
situation where a majority of militarily-trained Americans become
undutiful, that is sufficient reason for higher authority to
resurvey its own judgments, disciplines and line of action.</p>

<p class="proposition">XIV</p>

<p>To lie to American troops to cover up a blunder in combat
rarely serves any valid purpose. They have a good sense of combat
and an uncanny instinct for ferreting out the truth when
anything goes wrong tactically. They will excuse mistakes but
they will not forgive being treated like children.</p>

<p class="proposition">XV</p>

<p>When spit-and-polish are laid on so heavily that they become
onerous, and the ranks cannot see any legitimate connection
between the requirements and the development of an attitude
which will serve a clear fighting purpose, it is to be questioned
that the exactions serve any good object whatever.</p>

<p class="proposition">XVI</p>

<p>On the other hand, because standards of discipline and courtesy
are designed for the express purpose of furthering control
under the extraordinary frictions and pressures of the battlefield,
their maintenance under combat conditions is as necessary
as during training. Smartness and respect are the marks of
military alertness, no matter how trying the circumstances. But
courtesy starts at the top, in the dealing of any officer with his
subordinates, and in his decent regard for their loyalty, intelligence,
and manhood.</p>

<p class="proposition">XVII</p>

<p>Though Americans enjoy relatively a bountiful, and even
luxurious standard of living in their home environment, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
do not have to be pampered, spoon-fed and surfeited with
every comfort and convenience to keep them steadfast and
devoted, once war comes. They are by nature rugged men, and
in the field will respond most perfectly when called on to play
a rugged part. Soft handling will soften even the best men.
But even the weak man will develop a new vigor and confidence
in the face of necessary hardship, if moved by a leadership
which is courageously making the best of a bad situation.</p>

<p class="proposition">XVIII</p>

<p>Extravagance and wastefulness is somewhat rooted in the
American character, because of our mode of life. When our
men enter military service, there is a strong holdover of their
prodigal civilian habits. Even under fighting conditions, they
tend to be wasteful of drinking water, food, munitionment and
other vital supply. When such things are made <em>too</em> accessible,
they tend to throw them away, rather than to conserve them in
the general interests. This is a distinct weakness during combat,
when conservation of all supply is the touchstone of success.
The regulating of all supply, and the preventing of waste in any
form, is the prime obligation of every officer.</p>

<p class="proposition">XIX</p>

<p>Under the conditions of battle, any extra work, exercise,
maneuver or <em>marching which does not serve a clear and direct
operational purpose</em> is unjustifiable. The supreme object is to
keep men as physically fresh and mentally alert as possible.
Tired men take fright and are half-whipped before the battle
opens. Worn-out officers cannot make clear decisions. The conservation
of men's powers, not the exhaustion thereof, is the
way of successful operation.</p>

<p class="proposition">XX</p>

<p>When forces are committed to combat, it is vital that not
one unnecessary pound be put on any man's back. Lightness of
foot is the key to speed of movement and the increase of firepower.
In judging of these things, every officer's thought should
be on the optimistic side. It is better to take the chance that
men will manage to get by on a little less than to overload them,
through an over-cautious reckoning of every possible contin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>gency,
thereby destroying their power to do anything effectively.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXI</p>

<p>Even a thorough training and long practice in weapons handling
will not always insure that a majority of men will use their
weapons freely and consistently when engaging the enemy. This
is particularly true of Americans. In youth they are taught that
the taking of human life is wrong. This feeling is deep-rooted
in their emotions. Many of them cannot shake it off when the
hour comes that their own lives are in danger. They fail to
fire, though they do not know exactly why. In war, firing at an
enemy target can be made a habit. Once required to make the
start, because he is given personal and intelligent direction, any
man will find it easier to fire the second and third time, and
soon thereafter his response will become automatic in any tactical
situation. When engaging the enemy, the most decisive task
of all junior leaders is to make certain that <em>all</em> men along the
line are employing their weapons, even if this means spending
some time with each man and directing his fire. Reconnaissance
and inspection toward this end, particularly in the early stages
of initial engagement, are far more important than the employment
of weapons by junior leaders themselves, since this latter
tends to distract their attention from what the men are doing.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXII</p>

<p>Unity of action develops from fullness of information. In
combat, all ranks have to know what is being done, and why
it is being done, if confusion is to be kept to a minimum. This
holds true in all types of operation, whatever the service.
However, a surfeit of information clouds the mind and may
sometimes depress the spirit. We can take one example. A commander
might be confronted by a complex situation, and his
solution may comprise a continuing operation in three distinct
phases. It would be advisable that all hands be told the complete
detail of "phase A." But it might be equally sensible that
only his subordinates who are closest to him be made fully informed
about "phase B," and "phase C." All plans in combat
are subject to modification as circumstances dictate; this be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>ing
the case, it is better not to muddle men by filling their minds
with a seeming conflict in ideas. More important still, if the
grand object seems too vast and formidable, even the first step
toward it may appear doubly difficult. Fullness of information
does not void the other principle that one thing at a time,
carefully organized all down the line, is the surest way.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXIII</p>

<p>There is no excuse for malingering or cowardice during battle.
It is the task of leadership to stop it, by whatever means would
seem to be the surest cure, always making certain that in so
doing it will not make a bad matter worse.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXIV</p>

<p>The Armed Services recognize that there are occasional individuals
whose nervous and spiritual makeup may be such that,
though they erode rapidly and may suffer complete breakdown
under combat conditions, they still may be wholly loyal and
conscientious men, capable of doing high duty elsewhere. Men
are not alike. In some, however willing the spirit, the flesh may
still be weak. To punish, degrade or in any way humiliate such
men is not more cruel than ignorant. When the good faith of
any individual has been repeatedly demonstrated in his earlier
service, he deserves the benefit of the doubt from his superior,
pending study of his case by medical authority. But if the man
has been a bad actor consistently, his officer is warranted in
proceeding on the assumption that his combat failure is just
one more grave moral dereliction. To fail to take proper action
against such a man can only work unusual hardship on the
majority trying to do duty.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXV</p>

<p>The United States abides by the laws of war. Its armed forces,
in their dealing with all other peoples, are expected to comply
with the laws of war, in the spirit and to the letter. In waging
war, we do not terrorize helpless non-combatants, if it is within
our power to avoid so doing. Wanton killing, torture, cruelty or
the working of unusual and unnecessary hardship on enemy
prisoners or populations is not justified in any circumstance.
Likewise, respect for the reign of law, <em>as that term is under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>stood
in the United States</em>, is expected to follow the flag wherever
it goes. Pillaging, looting and other excesses are as unmoral
where Americans are operating under military law as when they
are living together under the civil code. None the less, some
men in the American services will loot and destroy property,
unless they are restrained by fear of punishment. War looses
violence and disorder; it inflames passions and makes it relatively
easy for the individual to get away with unlawful actions.
But it does not lessen the gravity of his offense or make it less
necessary that constituted authority put him down. The main
safeguard against lawlessness and hooliganism in any armed body
is the integrity of its officers. When men know that their commander
is absolutely opposed to such excesses, and will take
forceful action to repress any breach of discipline, they will conform.
But when an officer winks at any depradation by his men,
it is no different than if he had committed the act.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXVI</p>

<p>On the field of sport Americans always "talk it up" to keep
nerves steady and to generate confidence. The need is even
greater on the field of war, and the same treatment will have
no less effect. When men are afraid, they go silent; silence of
itself further intensifies their fear. The resumption of speech is
the beginning of thoughtful, collected action, for self-evidently,
two or more men cannot join strength and work intelligently
together until they know one another's thoughts. <em>Consequently,
all training is an exercise in getting men to open up and become
articulate even as it is a process in conditioning them physically
to move strongly and together.</em></p>

<p class="proposition">XXVII</p>

<p>Inspection is more important in the face of the enemy than
during training because a fouled piece may mean a lost battle,
an overlooked sick man may infect a fortress and a mislaid
message can cost a war. In virtue of his position, every junior
leader is an inspector, and the obligation to make certain that
his force at all times is inspection proof is unremitting.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXVIII</p>

<p>In battle crisis, a majority of Americans present will respond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
to any man who has the will and the brains to give them a clear,
intelligent order. They will follow the lowest-ranking man present
if he obviously knows what he is doing and is morally the
master of the situation, but they will not obey a chuckle-head
if he has nothing in his favor but his rank.</p>

<p class="proposition">XXIX</p>

<p>In any action in which the several services are joined, any
American officer may expect the same measure of respect from
the ranks of any other service as from his own, provided he
conducts himself with a dignity and manner becoming an
American officer.</p>

<p>For all officers, due reflection on these points, relating to the
character of our men in war, is not more important than a
continuing study of how they may be applied to all aspects of
training, toward the end that we may further strengthen our
own system. This is the grand object in all military studies.
That service is most perfect which best holds itself, at all times
and at all levels, in a state of readiness to move against and
destroy any declared enemy of the United States.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
